## IFNTTNT: If-Not-This-Then-Not-That

An app that allows you to do certain things on your smartphone only if certain conditions are met. Say you want to spend less time looking at Instagram and more time messaging reaching out to old friends who live in other cities. The app would allow you to go on Instagram only if you've messaged one of those friends in the past 30 minutes. Rather than if-this-then-that, it would be if-not-this-then-not-that.

## Goodreads <-> public library account

Connect Goodreads account to public library account; see which items on your "to read" list are currently available at your local branch.

## Thesaurus plug-in for smartphone typing

I don't want to have to switch over to a thesaurus app! I want to be able to just select a word I've just typed, and see a list of synonyms that I might wish to replace it with.
