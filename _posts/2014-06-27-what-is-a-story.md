There are lots of common words that we use intuitively without carrying around a ready-made definition for them. If put on the spot, most of us would stutter at least a little bit in trying to give non-self-referential definitions for words like "power," "love," and "maturity." Luckily, the dictionary seems to pull through for us in most cases.

Apparently not so with the word "story." I've yet to find a dictionary that manages to capture exactly what it is that we mean when we say this word, even though using it never seems to evoke confusion.

Attempts to define the story seem to give it the following characteristics:

1. It relates a series of events that are causally linked.
2. It is used to entertain, to inform, or to instruct.
3. It can be either factual or imaginary.

This is a good start. I find it difficult to imagine a story that breaks one of these rules. However, I think it's possible to follow these rules and not qualify as a story. For example: "The egg broke because it fell off the counter." This statement could easily have all of the above characteristics, but I don't think it qualifies. So I think there must be more to, well, the story.

One element of the story that seems to be missing from all of the definitions that I've read, and that I think is crucial, is that the story involves selectively withholding and providing information for a particular effect. Even if, in a series of statements (or images – the medium is not important), the causal links between certain events are made clear, those statements only become a story when they are presented in a way that causes a build and release of what I suppose I'll call informational tension. Similar to the difference between noise and music – which is that in music, the notes, and more importantly, the silences, are deliberately ordered by the musician – the difference between a series of statements and a story is that in a story, the information, and more importantly, the lack of information, is deliberately ordered by the storyteller.

Another crucial element, which may be so obviously fundamental that no definition would bother to include it, is that the story must involve change. The beginning doesn't necessarily need to be different from the end, but a story cannot simply describe a totally static state of affairs. In other words, a story must have a narrative arc. A narrative point in space is not a story.

There are two other things that some would include in the definition of the story: character, and dramatic conflict. While I think both of these are helpful for creating interesting stories, I'm not sure that they're fundamental.

The question of character is difficult because when we think of a character, we generally think of a conscious, living being with motivations or fears that drive a plot. But say we wanted to tell the story of a tree in the rainforest, starting out as a sapling, competing with surrounding plants to harness the most possible sunlight, eventually growing gigantic. Say we wanted to tell the story of a company, with its modest birth as a hopeful start-up, its expansion into massive empire, and its ultimate bankruptcy. Say we wanted to tell the story of the Big Bang. These stories don't necessarily include characters that are conscious or even alive. What they do include is agents or players that have some concrete existence in time and space; they can change or be changed by their environment. I'd amend the definition of the story to necessarily include not characters, but agents.

As for dramatic conflict, I think it can only exist if either an agent has desires or fears that don't match up with that agent's reality, or if our identification with the agent allows us to subsume those desires or fears just by dint of our involvement in the story. I think it's possible to have stories that include no dramatic conflict – for example, in the story of the Big Bang, I doubt many of us would cheer for a particular quark or gluon – but those stories might be very boring unless there is some other factor that keeps us interested.

So here's my definition of the story: it is an entertaining, informative, or instructional recounting of a series of causally related events, either factual or imaginary, that are arranged or organized so as to produce informational tension, and that include one or more agents that change or are changed by their environment.

Not the catchiest definition, I know. But hopefully it's a bit more comprehensive than the definitions found in most dictionaries.

I think it will be helpful to have this definition in my back-pocket as I sit down to write stories in the future. Hopefully it will help guide my writing.

What is it that you have in mind when you decide to write or tell a story? Have I made the definition more complex than it needs to be, or have I missed something important?
