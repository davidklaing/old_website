Why you should speak up more: 

- Speaking time is usually very asymmetric. I'm talking to all you people in that big hump at the bottom.
- You're bad at predicting whether your ideas are worth others' time.
- Silence usually makes a false contribution to the consensus.
- You don't have to win an argument to shape an outcome.
- The quality of your thoughts improves faster when others can correct or build upon them.
