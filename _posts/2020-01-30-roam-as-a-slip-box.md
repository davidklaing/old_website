I’ve been experimenting with a new note-taking system. It’s called the “slip-box” method, so named because originally it comprised a literal box into which the notetaker would slip index cards.

I’ve been using the slip-box method for only a month, so I’m still firmly in the honeymoon phase. But let me tell you: if I were a professional academic researcher or nonfiction writer, the slip-box would be a game-changer. It wouldn’t surprise me if this method were totally commonplace in grad schools twenty years from now.

The slip-box method excites me for two reasons. One: it’s a system for reflecting privately on the things I read—for checking my understanding, for improving retention of information, and for identifying questions to follow up on. Two: it’s a system for making connections between ideas. I pretty much buy the claim that creativity is mostly a matter of combining things in unusual ways, and the slip-box is a playground designed specifically for that.

The slip-box includes two kinds of notes: *literature* notes and *permanent* notes. Literature notes are paraphrases of ideas and arguments encountered during research, complete with references, while permanent notes are the notetaker’s ‘original’ thoughts. Both types of notes are written in publishable-quality prose, and each note is meant to include enough detail that it could be understood in isolation.

The magic starts once you’ve built up a handful of notes, because that’s when you can start connecting them to each other. The inventor of the slip-box method, the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, connected his notes by managing an intricate system of IDs. But now we have software that can manage connections for us.

Enter Roam Research, a new note-taking power-tool that early users are going absolutely bonkers over. I too have joined the cult. Roam is special for many reasons, one of which is that it’s a perfect platform for building a modern slip-box. (Roam’s founder, Conor White-Sullivan, was heavily influenced by Luhmann and his slip-box.)

Still, I haven't yet seen any accounts of how to use Roam as a slip-box. With the caveat that I’m still new to both Roam and the slip-box method, I thought I’d share my current system.

If you aren’t somewhat familiar with Roam, let me apologize up front: I’m about to go into the weeds. If this all sounds cool, you should go read Nat Eliason's [Roam: Why I Love it and How I Use It](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam).

When I first started experimenting with the slip-box method in Roam, I had three big questions:

1. **Where should I write my notes?** Should each note be its own page, or its own block? How should I manage note metadata, if at all?
2. **How should I distinguish between types of notes?** How should literature notes differ from permanent notes, and how should both of them differ from other use of Roam that I might want to engage in separately from slip-box notetaking?
3. **How should I connect my notes to each other?** By inline page links, by sub-blocks, or something else?

My answers to these questions are in three Roam features: Daily Notes pages, tags, and block references.

**Daily Notes pages.** I write all my literature notes and permanent notes into my daily notes. This makes it easy to track when I wrote each note, and means that other notes or thoughts can conveniently added in parallel.

**Tags**: I have a tag for literature notes (hashtag litnote) and a tag for permanent notes (#permnote). I include these tags, as well as any relevant reference material, at the end of the relevant blocks. For example, the block I am currently writing is a permanent note, so I will include the permanent note tag at the end of this block.

**Block references**: One of the keys to the [[Zettlekasten]] is that you need to be able to connect your notes to each other. Roam of course allows inline links to other pages, but sometimes you don't want to link a block to a whole *page*, but simply to another block. One way to do this would be to create and indent a new block that follows the one you are "replying" to, but since I write all my notes in my daily notes, this method would prevent me from knowing when I wrote the reply unless it was on the same day as the original. So instead I use block references: by typing double parentheses and searching for the block of interest, I can insert that block into my current block at any point and fill out the rest of my block with whatever information I wish to add.
