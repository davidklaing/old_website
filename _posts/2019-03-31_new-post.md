As a graduate of the first cohort of UBC's Master of Data science program, I often get questions from current and prospective students about how to get a data science job. Specific questions usually look something like this:

- How should I format my resume?
- What should I talk about in my cover letter?
- Which job boards should I be checking?
- How can I succeed in a coding interview?

I think a lot of these questions stem from some misconceptions:

- There is someone whose job it is to read cover letters and resumes all day, and to get an interview your first challenge is to impress them.

In fact, most recruitment happens via referrals. I used to think that people said this to get points for cynicism. It's not what you know; it's who you know. But referrals aren't really about nepotism. They're more about trust.
