Technical interviews hard to prepare for, for interviewees and interviewers alike. Having been on both sides of the table a few times now, I have some thoughts on how to make the process fruitful for both parties: on the interviewer's side, how to assess the right skills; on the interviewee's side, how to demonstrate them.

This week I was on a panel at the University of British Columbia about technical interviews in data science. I was asked to prepare some interview questions for students to work on in groups.

1. You work for a bank, and you've been asked to write a Python or R package to facilitate ongoing analysis of online surveys which are sent to customers every time they visit a branch in person. What first steps would you take to ensure that this project is successful? Be specific: what is on your to-do list for the first couple days of package development?
2. A senior executive at your company has heard that one of your models, which uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict house prices, involves something called a "bias-variance tradeoff". They want to know what this tradeoff is, and also why your algorithm seems to depend so much on "neighboring" houses, when there ought to be other relevant factors to consider. How would you explain?
3. You work for a company that offers a subscription-based meditation app. You have behavioral data about each user â€“ how often they open the app, which pages they visit, etc. After creating around 20 features, one of your colleagues built a multiple logistic regression model to predict whether a user will cancel their subscription in the next month. They found that just one behavior has a statistically significant relationship with cancellation: the frequency at which the user opens the app before 9:00am. Your colleague is proposing that a notification be sent by default every morning, and wants to know your thoughts. What questions would you ask about their analysis, and what do you think of their conclusion?
