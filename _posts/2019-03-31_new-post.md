Imagine you are looking to hire a data scientist. You open up your applicant tracking system and read the most recent application for the job you posted three days ago. The person has a promising profile:

- Bachelor's degree with a double-major in computer science and economics
- Master's degree in economics
- One year of part-time consulting in data mining and analytics

However, you already have a shortlist of 20 candidates to be considered for a phone screen. You've read through 120 applications in the past three days, and many of them looked just as promising as this one. In all likelihood, you won't return to this applicant's profile. For all you know, this person is all talk. Anyone can put the words "data mining" on a resume.

You go to the top of your shortlist. This person has a similarly promising profile:

- Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering
- Professional master's in data science
- One year of experience as a data scientist, with a special interest in deep learning for NLP

By their profile alone, this person is no more promising than the other. But this person is at the top of your shortlist, while the other person is already forgotten. Why? Two reasons.

1. This person linked to their blog, where they demonstrated their skills by writing tutorials on implementing state-of-the-art deep learning models for sentence classification.
2. This person came recommended by one of your current employees.

The basic model of hiring is that when a company hires someone, they want to be as confident as possible that the person 1) *can* and 2) *will* do the job. Most people's resumes do extremely little on their own to inspire this confidence, especially in a tough job market. But referrals 



Your challenge, then, is to create patent evidence of those two qualities – your skills and your character – and then bring it to the attention of the team you want to work on.

The best way to create evidence of your skills is to use them and then share the artifacts of your work. This doesn't have to be a public thing. You can do a project that is targeted directly at the company you want to work for. Read the job posting carefully to figure out what the responsibilities are, and then spend a weekend putting together a small project that demonstrates your ability to fulfill those responsibilities. 

Sometimes the job posting will include details about a take-home assessment that will be required as part of the interview process. 99% of people who apply to the position will just submit a resume and a boiler-plate cover letter; they wouldn't dream of doing the take-home assessment before even getting a first interview. So a great way to stand out is to just do the project anyways. Even if nothing comes of it, you're likely to learn something valuable in the process, and as long as there are no confidentiality issues, you can always share that project when applying to other companies. The important thing is that you've created evidence of your skills.



You might worry – what if you *can't* do the job? When I finished my master's degree, I worried as much as anybody that I wasn't yet prepared for real-world data work. Luckily, at most companies the data science hiring process is discriminative enough that you're unlikely to be hired if you lack the skills to do the job. My sense is that false positives are fairly rare. This means that your path is clear: create evidence of what you *can* do, and if that's not enough, learn some new stuff and repeat.



Create unfakeable evidence of your skills

- do a project for your dream company
- write blog posts
- have side projects
- if you don't have ideas, just pick a textbook and read it and then summarize the chapters

Create unfakeable evidence of your character, i.e. network, be courteous

Networking:

- write blog posts
- be a generous and nice person
- attend events, and ask questions during talks
- ask for referrals

Resumes:

- no typos
- parallelism
- basic symmetry and sense of whitespace, etc
- one page or two pages doesn't matter
- links to places where you can find more details
- don't use those skill bar things – lack of self-awareness

Cover letters:

- You're looking in the wrong place

Technical interviews hard to prepare for, for interviewees and interviewers alike. Having been on both sides of the table a few times now, I have some thoughts on how to make the process fruitful for both parties: on the interviewer's side, how to assess the right skills; on the interviewee's side, how to demonstrate them.

This week I was on a panel at the University of British Columbia about technical interviews in data science. I was asked to prepare some interview questions for students to work on in groups.

1. You work for a bank, and you've been asked to write a Python or R package to facilitate ongoing analysis of online surveys which are sent to customers every time they visit a branch in person. What first steps would you take to ensure that this project is successful? Be specific: what is on your to-do list for the first couple days of package development?
2. A senior executive at your company has heard that one of your models, which uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict house prices, involves something called a "bias-variance tradeoff". They want to know what this tradeoff is, and also why your algorithm seems to depend so much on "neighboring" houses, when there ought to be other relevant factors to consider. How would you explain?
3. You work for a company that offers a subscription-based meditation app. You have behavioral data about each user – how often they open the app, which pages they visit, etc. After creating around 20 features, one of your colleagues built a multiple logistic regression model to predict whether a user will cancel their subscription in the next month. They found that just one behavior has a statistically significant relationship with cancellation: the frequency at which the user opens the app before 9:00am. Your colleague is proposing that a notification be sent by default every morning, and wants to know your thoughts. What questions would you ask about their analysis, and what do you think of their conclusion?
