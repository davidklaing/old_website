Anyone who has been following my blog over the past few weeks may have noticed that so far, for each of my posts that is categorized as Academic, there is an analogous post categorized as Creative. I'm currently exploring the parallel structures between arguments and stories. This can only last so long, because the two forms will inevitably diverge as I consider the finer details of each, but for now it's an interesting exercise.

This week, in Academic, I wrote a short post on thesis statements and what makes for a strong one. My driving point (dare I say my thesis) was that the thesis is the heart of the essay – the essay exists to support it, and would have no business existing otherwise. I'm now tasked with defining and examining the thesis statement's cousin: the heart of the story.

I'm calling it the conceit, in the sense that one can conceive of an idea or a plan. Essentially, it's the idea for the story, distilled to its most concise articulation. It's the shortest, truest answer to the question that I learned to dread most while I was writing my first novel this past year: "What's it about?"

A few examples. I'm a great admirer of Vince Gilligan, so let's start with Breaking Bad: it's about a high school chemistry teacher who gets diagnosed with lung cancer and turns to cooking meth to help pay the bills. How about Romeo and Juliet? It's about two young lovers whose families are feuding. Life of Pi: it's about a young boy who gets trapped on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. Twilight: it's about a young woman whose otherwise satisfactory boyfriend wants to kill her and drink her blood.

It's much more difficult to identify the characteristics of a good conceit than it is for a thesis statement, just as the value or quality of a story is much more difficult to determine than the strength of an argument. It will depend on so much more than just evidence and reasoning – things like voice, pace, relatability, moral undertone, etc. But I think there are a few qualities in a conceit that we can count on to promise, in the hands of the right writer, a compelling and elegant story.

First, the conceit is problematic: the primary conflict of the story should be detectable in it. This conflict, this problem, doesn't need to be explored or revealed in any elaborate way, but it should be central enough to the story that it has a place in the one-sentence answer to the what's-it-about question. This way, the character or characters will be sure to struggle against something that threatens their lives or livelihoods.

Second, the conceit is provoking: it lets the reader (or listener or viewer or what have you) imagine experiencing a strong emotion, be it fear, anger, despair, or something else that deviates from perfect equanimity. Ideally, this emotion is a negative one, otherwise the conceit is probably not problematic, but I will admit that in some cases, the conceit could provoke a positive emotion and still be quite good. For example, Harry Potter: it's about a young boy who finds out he is a famous wizard and goes off to a magic school where he makes friends and has adventures. The beauty of the conceit of Harry Potter is that it provokes a vicarious fulfilment of three universal human desires: to feel special, to have a home, and to be loved. Of course, each individual book in the series has its own conceit, and in each there would be a problem and probably a negative emotion. But the point is that the conceit should ensure that the story will produce feelings.

As with the thesis statement, I think it would help for the conceit to also be as specific and concise as possible. In this case, though, it's more for aesthetic reasons than for practical ones. Essentially, the more interesting a problem the conceit can present, the stronger an emotion it can provoke, and the fewer words it needs to use, the better a story it will promise.

Obviously, I can't prove that any of what I'm saying here is true. It just seems true to me, based on my lifelong consumption of stories and my continued attempts to explain to myself and others what these stories are about.

Now having come up with my own definitions for both the story and the conceit – the nucleus of the story, if you will – I'm going to spend the next two weeks exploring the basics of plotting. We're on our way to figuring out how to create and tell a story from scratch.
