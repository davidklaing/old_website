Doing an annual review is similar to making New Year's resolutions, but it's more comprehensive and structured—a way to reflect, celebrate, and commemorate your the recent past and plan a more intentional future. This year I did my own first review, and in the process I sought out examples and guidance from others. Here are the lessons I learned:

# 1. Consider the price of new habits.

In [Cost-First New Year's Resolutions](https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/cost-first-new-years-resolutions-6bb30393201d), Byrne Hobart notes that every minute or dollar you plan to spend on a new behavior must be withdrawn from an existing one. So, rather than making "outcome-first" resolutions, which focus on the outcome you desire, you should make "cost-first" resolutions, which focus on the price of that outcome. Want to exercise more? Great. What will you do _less_ of to find the time? Here are some examples from Hobart:

> - Instead of "lose X pounds" or "work out Y times per week," set a goal like "somebody will make fun of me for being a picky eater."
> - Instead of "read more books," set a goal like "I'll be the last of my friends to see the end of *Game of Thrones*."
> - Instead of "save $X," promise yourself that 2019’s vacation will be much crappier than last year’s.
> - Instead of "waste less time online," target "In 2019, least one person on Twitter, Instagram, or Reddit will ask 'What ever happened to' me."

# 2. Try to preserve optionality.

One of the problems with setting goals for a whole year in advance is that throughout the year you will learn new information. Your goals will become invalidated or uncalibrated when you

In [Antifragile Planning](https://taylorpearson.me/planning/), Taylor Pearson describes a goal-setting system that privileges _optionality_—the quality of having options. To this end, he recommends doing a complete review and goal-setting session every three months. This involves the following:

- Reviewing a 25-year vision document, outlining your ideal future 25 years down the line, as concretely as possible.
- Reviewing a Perfect Day document, outlining your idea of a perfect day: where you live, what you do, who you hang out with, etc.
- Setting 1-3 goals for the quarter that you believe are most likely to get you closest to your 25-year vision and your perfect day.

Pearson recommends repeating the goal-setting process in a fractal pattern on monthly and weekly timescales. Every month, he asks, "what are the 1-3 things that would move me closest to my quarterly goals?". Every week, he asks, "what are the 1-3 things that would move me closest to my monthly goals?"

# 3. Calibrate your goals by zooming out.

# 4. Consider doing deep dives into many life areas.

Vermeer recommends asking targeted questions about around a dozen life categories, like health & fitness, family & relationships, work & productivity, career & purpose, adventure & play, etc. He recommends giving a grade for each one, and then prioritizing a few areas and setting goals for each.

# 5. Make up your own system.
