One evening last fall, I was invited to join a group of ten people to play a board game called Avalon. The game is a contest between two teams: good and bad. The catch is that the bad people, who know each other's identities, are pretending to be good, so the good people, who know only their own identities, don't know who they can trust. At each turn, one person proposes a subset of players to go on a mission, and that subset is approved or denied by a majority vote by all players. If the subset is approved, then each person in the subset anonymously votes to pass or fail the mission. If there is even a single failure, then the mission fails. By the end of many rounds, if there are more failed missions than successful ones, the bad team wins. Otherwise, the good team wins. The bad people try to get themselves chosen for the missions, in order to fail them, and the good people try to prevent this at all costs.

The setup is simple, but within minutes the gameplay is dizzying. As a bad player, you have good information: you look out on the group and you know exactly which players are lying. But you can't reveal that you know this, lest you undermine their identities or your own. Indeed, the only way to protect this information is to speak and act as if you know only that you yourself are good. As a good player, you have limited information: you know that some people out there are coordinating to deceive you, but not much else. The only resources you have are your eyes, your ears, your voice, and your votes.

When I played Avalon that evening, I was assigned to the good team. I was the only one in the group who had never played before, and barely knew any of the other people, who all knew each other quite well. Because of this, I took a backseat for the first few rounds, speaking very little. To my surprise, this caused many players to strongly suspect that I was bad.

"If you're good," [one of them]([http://kwokchain.com/](http://kwokchain.com/)) said to me, "you need to talk more."

I protested that bad people can speak just as easily as good people. How could my words engender trust when any word I said might be a lie?

What I failed to understand was that because of the burden of deception, talking is much more cognitively demanding for bad people than it is for good people. It's hard to maintain a consistent lie over the course of the whole game. This means that the best strategy for those on the good team is to consistently share their own thoughts and solicit those of all others. The game will be easiest for the good team if every player is expected to regularly give a clear account of their identity, their observations, and their reasoning. Conversely, the game will be easiest for the bad team without this norm of openness.

*If you're good, you need to talk more.* I've thought about this idea a lot in the past six months, and it seems to me that it goes far beyond the game of Avalon. The dynamics of the game are manifest any time a group of people come together to make a decision. Do the individuals in the group have their own self-interest to consider? Do they have the opportunity to coordinate with some but not all others, and covertly? Do they each possess a unique perspective that might influence the outcome of a decision, if they share that perspective honestly? Are they free to withold their perspective?

I believe there are many situations where the answers to all of these questions are "yes." And in all those cases, "talk more" is a crucial virtue. Why is it so poorly appreciated? Why was I initially so resistant to the idea that if I'm good, I need to talk more? I can think of several reasons.

1. The more you talk, the more danger you are in of being perceived as rude. It's a rare person who becomes hated or avoided for talking too *little*. This is doubly true in contentious conversations. Parents caution their children: "think before you speak", "don't be a blabbermouth", and "if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all." When optimizing for politeness, restraint is always preferrable to openness.

Although many conversations will pass in which I say little or nothing, I'm trying to view those instances as being equally undesirable to ones in which I speak the whole time. I suppose it's understandable that when we socialize our children, we hint at there being a monotonic relationship between words spoken and politeness. But there obviously isn't. I've heard it said that if you're in a conversation with one other person, you should aim to talk 50% of the time. Let's generalize that: if it's you and \(n\) others, aim for (\\frac{1}{n+1}\)%, and if you can, use some of that time to prompt the quieter people, so as to smooth out that long-tailed distribution.

2. Talkativeness is seen as a personality trait more than it's seen as a choice. To the extent that people are urged to talk more, it's usually to help those people overcome shyness and succeed socially, rather than to improve the health of the group's common knowledge. In other words, deliberately talking more is usually something people do for themselves, not for others.

We humans like to compartmentalize; there's no way around it. But I wish it were easier to remember that our behaviors and choices can be simultaneously good for ourselves and good for others. Don't just donate to charity because it helps the recipients; do it because it feels good and gives more meaning to your life. And don't just invest money to give yourself a better quality of life in the future; do it so you can keep donating to charity after you stop working. "Talk more" fits not only in the genre of self-help, but also in that of epistemic citizenship.

3. It is considered ineffectual, and sometimes actively counterproductive, to opine on subjects in which you are uninformed or undecided. We internalize the idea that we need to do our homework and think through our positions carefully before sharing, so that we don't waste everyone's time and attention.

If you're like me, you attend many meetings at work in which you feel doubtful of or confused about claims people make. Those people may also be extremely smart. In these meetings I often find it challenging to speak my mind, especially when I need to expend a lot of energy just to understand other people's perspectives, let alone feel confident in my own. But I have learned, through feedback and experience, that the less confident I am in my opinion, the more important it is for me to speak up. I think this is because when I'm feeling uncertain, it's likely that other people are too. The more confident voices dominate the conversation, and everyone tends to nod along or just sit there in silence, because they don't have a rebuttal prepared. Something my manager told me, which I think is brilliant, is that it's far better to say "I don't know about this, but I need to think about it" than to say nothing and *then* go off and do your homework. Silence is tacit agreement with the consensus.

4. It is often costly to offer perspectives that ultimately get rejected by the group. If you know that the group's decision will fall within certain parameters, and your own optimal solution lies outside those parameters, then it may be best to argue for the best option among those that are likely to be accepted, rather than be totally ignored. For example, many people who would prefer above all else an unlikely political outcome will instead vote for their favorite option among those they think are likely.

I think it's okay to sometimes set aside your unpopular ideas and budget your capital (whether social or otherwise) on ideas that have a chance of winning. But I once heard it said that an idea doesn't have to win, or even be accepted by anybody, for it to shape the conversation or the outcome in a meaningful way. So if you feel inclined to share a perspective in good faith that you know will be unpopular, I would commend you for expressing it.

5. Humility leads people to discount their inside view in favor of the wisdom of the crowd. This is often a good guide to behavior. For example, most of us will be much better investors if we buy index funds than if we pick our own stocks.

The crowd is only wise if people like you contribute your perspective to it. [Julia Galef](https://juliagalef.com/) once made the point that it can be fruitful to simultaneously hold both an inside view and an outside view. Even if you ultimately decide to act on the outside view, consider it virtuous to first contribute your inside view to whichever group or forum or was the source of your outside view. After all, if you aren't doing this, what makes you so sure that the people who *are* adding their perspectives to the common pool are sufficiently informed and uncorrelated from each other that the crowd is wise in the first place?

Real life usually isn't as adversarial as Avalon. But I would highly recommend finding a group of people to play the game with. I know of no other experience that better condenses the challenges of collaborative truth-seeking, or that is more illustrative of the responsibility of good people to do more talking.
