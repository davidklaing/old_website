The thesis is the heart of the argumentative essay. Without it, the essay lies dead on the page. If you want to write a good essay, it's crucial that you come up with a strong thesis statement.

The thesis is the claim that the essayist sets out to prove by writing the essay. The essay exists to provide support for the thesis, so that by reading the essay, the reader becomes convinced that the thesis is true.

A strong thesis statement is debatable, relevant, specific, and concise.

It must be debatable because otherwise there would be no point writing the essay in the first place; it would be like building a boat in the middle of the desert. To test whether your thesis is debatable, imagine telling it to somebody and then hearing them say, "that's not true." Can you take them seriously? If so, your thesis is probably debatable.

When I say that the thesis statement must be relevant, I mean that it must be relevant to somebody's interests or concerns. This somebody could be you, but more likely it will be your reader, who is likely the person grading you. If you write a brilliant essay that doesn't answer the question you've been assigned, then it's probably because your thesis is not relevant to the interests or concerns of your reader.

The thesis has to be specific so that the argument can be grounded in evidence and reasoning – essentially, so that it can be debatable. If the thesis is too general, it will be difficult or impossible to know when it's been established as true or false. A thesis that is bound by specific parameters is much easier to support or refute.

Finally, the thesis must be concise. This is not a hard a fast rule, but I think it's best if you can express your thesis in a single sentence. If somebody were to ask you, "what is it that you're trying to argue?", you should be able to respond, "I'm trying to argue that [your thesis here]."

Having a strong thesis is the first step to writing a strong essay, but it's obviously not the last. The next step is to come up with an argument to support the thesis. Over the next two weeks, I'll go over basic argumentation to help you do it.
