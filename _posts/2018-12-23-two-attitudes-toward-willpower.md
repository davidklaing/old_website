One of the main topics in productivity and self-improvement is the asymmetry between present and future utilities. On one side of the asymmetry, enjoying the present often costs you a harder future: ice cream tastes great now, but it makes you fat later. On the other side, an easier future often costs you a more challenging present: you can stay slim, but only if you don't eat too much ice cream.

I've noticed recently that there are two main schools of thought about how to address this asymmetry. I'll call them 

## Pro-discipline

Catchphrases:

- No pain no gain

### People

- Marcus Aurelius
- Jocko Willinck
- Michael [here](https://twitter.com/mmay3r/status/1074406570560114688) and [here]()
- Mr. Money Mustache

Stoicism. Should you try to develop mental toughness, exercising your willpower like a muscle, welcoming pain? If it doesn't hurt, it's probably not good for you. Possible errors: overindexing on the heuristic that short-term good implies long-term bad, and that short-term bad implies long-term good.

## Pro-energy

### Catchphrases

- Go with the flow

### People

* Lao Tzu
* Scott Adams
* Naval Ravikant
* James Clear

Or should you structure your life so that you can hit minimal targets on minimal effort, optimizing for high energy, cancelling anything you dread?
