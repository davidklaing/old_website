I'm currently reading a book called _Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid_, by Douglas Hofstadter. It's quite long, but from what I gather from the first 200 pages, the book argues that the mind works like a formal system, and that intelligence arises from the ability to step outside that system. Let me explain what this means.

The type of system I'm referring to is one where rules can be applied to axioms (propositions that are self-evidently true) to generate any number of theorems (propositions that are not self-evident, but can be proven through reasoning). For example, in a game of Sudoku, you begin with a few numbers scattered throughout a 9x9 grid - these are your axioms. Your rules are that each 3x3 square, each row, and each column must contain all of the integers from 1 to 9. You start plugging in new numbers with the hope that you will satisfy these rules, and eventually fill every square. Assuming you don't break any rules, these new numbers are your theorems, and you proved them by reasoning from the axioms.

We assume that the mind is slightly more complex. In fact, it's probably a lot more like Sudoku on an infinitely large grid (maybe God plays it on weekends). The first system that Hofstadter presents is called the MIU-puzzle. The system is composed of strings of the three letters (M, I, and U), and you begin with a single axiom: MI. The challenge is to try to produce the string MU, and thus prove that it is a theorem. The rules are as follows:

- If you have a string that ends in I, you can add a U on the end.
- If you have a string Mx, where x is a string of letters, you can produce Mxx. For example, if you have MIU, you can produce MIUIU, or if you have MUM, you can produce MUMUM.
- If III appears in a string, you can replace it with U (but not the other way around).
- If UU appears in a string, you can drop it. For example, if you have UUU, you can produce U, or if you have MUUUII, you can get MUII.
- I tried it, and was not able to produce MU. Apparently the answer comes later in the book, but I haven't gotten there yet. Maybe you can solve it though; I'd recommend at least giving it a shot.

If you solved it, congratulations. If you tried and failed, like me, you're probably unsure as to whether or not MU is a theorem, because you weren't able to produce it using the rules. But what if instead you had been asked to produce the string U? Perhaps you would have gone through the same motions, but you probably would have stopped sooner, because none of the rules allow you to drop the M. Hofstadter says that you figured this out by stepping outside the system. If a computer were asked to perform the same task, it would generate theorems 'til kingdom come before realizing that it's impossible to produce U. This is not an explicit rule, but since the explicit rules are contingent on it, it is more like a metarule. It's a rule about the rules.

In more familiar terms, you could consider language as a formal system. Written language is made up of finite symbols, and spoken language is made up of finite sounds. The rules which govern the strings of symbols or sounds are contained in grammar, which is like a metalanguage. And if you discuss grammar, you're using a metametalanguage. You get the point.

So how does this pertain to knowledge, its uses, or lack thereof? My interpretation of Hofstadter to this point is that theorems in a formal system are counterparts to factual knowledge in our brains. Thinking is like carving a path through a dense forest of facts with the machete of reasoning. But at that point, we're just like the computer, wandering aimlessly. Luckily, most of us also have a GPS to give us directions to the meaningful conclusions. So we all have our own personal satellites tracking us from the sky, because part of the mind must exist outside the main system.

The title of the book comes from the mathematical theorems of Kurt Gödel, the art of M.C. Escher, and the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The common element is infinite regression. In Bach's "[Canon per Tonos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkccY6uU7hY)", at the point where the canon seems to end, there is a modulation (key change). It repeats until there is a new modulation, and though it may seem that this would only lead further and further away from the original key, after six modulations it returns to the original, one octave higher. It is an endlessly rising canon. You've probably seen the works of Escher before, but even if you haven't, I'm sure you understand the congruency:

Luckily for you, you're not one of the people climbing the stairs. You're the person sitting on the lower balcony, safely observing but not getting trapped in the infinite staircase.

Assuming that knowledge could be expressed as a string of symbols, it would only become useful if we were to assign meaning to it. If you'll bear with me for a final example, I'll describe Hofstadter's pq-system. It is composed of three symbols: p, q, and -, and the axiom is "- p - q - -". There is one rule: if _x_ p _y_ q _z_ is a theorem, where _x_, _y_, and _z_ are strings of dashes, then so is _x_ p _y_-q _z_-. If you were to try this, you would quickly realize that this system could symbolize a very simple mathematical concept: addition. You could even say that the p means "plus", the q means "equals", and strings of dashes represent numbers. You could apply the rule continuously and you would probably be satisfied with this interpretation. It would be meaningful, and so you could call these theorems "useful" knowledge. But as Hofstadter points out, there could be more than one interpretation. The symbols p, q, and - could mean "fairy", "crunchy", and "poo" for all it matters. This would be an example of a meaningless interpretation, rendering the knowledge quite useless. But is there only one meaningful interpretation? What if the symbol p meant "equals", and the q meant "taken from"?

Just as a formal system can be meaningful under one interpretation and meaningless under another, knowledge can be useful in some contexts and useless in others. In years past, the knowledge required to start a fire, hunt for a meal, or build a shelter was invaluable, and it would seem silly to learn instead how to read, or how to operate an iPod. And yet, which of these things are you more knowledgeable about? And I'm sure you're doing just fine. The usefulness of knowledge changes as you evaluate it in different contexts. Knowledge could be useful for survival, procreation, social dominance, or simply for the pleasure of learning, but it is likely that it will not be useful in all of these things. The important thing to remember is that all knowledge is useless without the tools to interpret it.
