We've got the heart; now it's time to make it beat.

The thesis is just a claim. It's the most important claim in the essay, but it's not good for anything unless it has a posse of other claims to back it up. It's a bit like West Side Story, where Tony is the thesis and the Jets are the premises. Bring them all together and get them snapping and jeering at Bernardo and his boys, and you've got yourself an argument.

To be clear, when I say the word 'argument,' I do not mean a dispute between people. I mean, in the words of Monty Python's Michael Palin, "a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition." Watch this video:

It's very meta; it's an argument about the definition of an argument. Michael Palin (glasses) is clearly the winner.

This is the video that I was shown on the first day of an argumentation class that I took when I was in my first year of university. I'd seen the sketch many times before, and it was nice to know that my professor had a sense of humour.

This week and next, I'm going to try to distill the contents of that course into a few hundred words. The textbook we used was called A Practical Study of Argument, by Trudy Govier, and although I no longer own it, I remember it being quite good.

In my own words: an argument is a claim or series of claims that are used to make another claim seem more plausible. In more anatomical language: an argument is a premise or series of premises that are used to make a conclusion seem more plausible. So there you have it. Tony is the conclusion (or the thesis), and the Jets are his supporting premises.

When you're setting out to write an essay, you start by coming up with the thesis statement. I went over that last week. Next you come up with the premises – these will be the main points that will fill the 'body paragraphs.'

Arguments can be presented in all sorts of ways. Sometimes the conclusion comes first, sometimes last, sometimes not at all – it's just implied. Sometimes there will be implied premises, ones that are not explicitly stated but instead left to be filled in by the person that the argument is addressed to. Sometimes an argument will be peppered with rhetoric. The point is that an argument can wear whatever dress she wants when she goes to the ball, but she's always the same girl underneath.

The best way to take a peek is to put the argument into what is called standardized form. It looks like this:

P1. All hooligans are chumps.
P2. All chumps are bozos.
C3. Therefore, all hooligans are bozos.

Obviously, P is for Premise and C is for Conclusion. It's pretty straightforward. All you have to do is list all of the premises, numbering them from one to whatever, ending with the conclusion.

When you're beginning to outline your essay, you should be able to standardize your argument so that you know exactly what you're working with.

Broadly, there are two types of arguments that you can make, and they differ in the way that the premises relate to each other.

The first type is called convergent. The premises in a convergent argument are like the Avengers: they're all trying to defeat Loki, but they are not so interdependent that if one of them dies, they all die. Each of them – the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America – could potentially win the battle alone. That is as it is with convergent arguments. Here's an example:

P1. Apples are healthy.
P2. Apples are tasty.
P3. Apples are affordable.
C4. Therefore, apples are great.

You'll notice that we could establish C4 with any one of the premises. All of the premises, when brought together, are probably stronger than just one on its own, but none of the premises relies on any other premise for its own strength, its own relevance.

The second type of argument is called linked. The premises in a linked argument are like Hiccup and Toothless (the young Viking boy and his dragon, from How to Train Your Dragon). Neither can fly without the other; Toothless is missing part of his tail, so he needs Hiccup to help him steer. And Hiccup doesn't have wings, so he can't fly on his own. This is as it is with linked arguments. Here's an example:

P1. If it rained today, then Martha is upset.
P2. It rained today.
C3. Therefore, Martha is upset.

Notice that we cannot establish C3 without both P1 and P2. They do not contribute to the conclusion independently. One without the other is useless. That's a linked argument.

When you're deciding what type of argument to use for your essay, you probably won't have to think consciously about which type of argument you're using. You'll be more guided by the evidence that is available to you. However, I want to briefly address a point that I've heard made by a couple writing tutors and teachers, which is that each new body paragraph needs to be implied by the previous. Not true! Yes, you can choose to write like that, and it might work out just fine. What that means is that you're making a particular kind of linked argument, and that is perfectly acceptable. You just don't need to use a linked argument. If you're writing an essay that uses a convergent argument, while I agree that you should avoid total non-sequiturs from one paragraph to the next, you don't need to try to construct false logical connections between separate, independent premises. That would be almost as silly as ignoring convergent arguments altogether – and that's pretty silly indeed.

This week, I've given a basic overview of the anatomy of an argument. This will hopefully help you put together something to start with. Next week, I'll give you the tools to evaluate the strength of an argument. These tools, lucky for us, are very easy to use, and even beyond your academic writing, you might enjoy putting them to work on the dozens of arguments that you hear in your day-to-day life. It's empowering stuff.
