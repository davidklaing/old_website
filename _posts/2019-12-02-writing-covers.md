description: What if it were common for writers to create "covers" of essays and books, the way musicians create covers songs?

When an aspiring musician first learn to play an instrument, they don't immediately start composing their own songs. They first learn to play the songs of others. The challenge of accurately reproducing existing melodies is enough to occupy a beginner for many months, so it would be distracting to require that every note also be original.

I wish writers would take the same approach. I'm not just making the standard argument that orginality is overratedâ€”"who cares if you were the *first* person to have this idea? "

Originality may be the ultimate goal, but focusing on it too early will hamper progress in developing technique. Besides, creating anything worthwhile will *require* that technique be effortless, locked into muscle memory.
