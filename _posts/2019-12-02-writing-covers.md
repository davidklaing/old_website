description: What if it were common for writers to create "covers" of essays and books, the way musicians create covers of songs?

When an aspiring musician first learns to play an instrument, they don't immediately start composing their own songs. They first learn to play the songs of others. It's hard enough to accurately reproduce existing melodies, let alone create new ones. Skills like intonation, modulating volume, and maintaining a consistent tempo are prioritized over skills like improvisation or lyricism, at least until the musician has developed a baseline of good technique.

When an aspiring writer first starts to hone their craft, however, they *do* immediately start creating their own arguments, their own stories, their own opinions. Skills like coherence, organization, and word choice are developed in parallel with skills like ideation and originality. Creating one's own content is not an imperative, exactly. But there is a widespread assumption that it would be crazy to go through the gruelling process of writing if you're not saying something new, not telling a story no one has heard before. I have never heard a conversation like this:

> "I'm working on a novel."
>
> "Cool, what's it about?"
>
> "It's *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*."
>
> "Oh, you mean like a fanfic?"
>
> "No, I'm just telling the story of Harry's first year at Hogwarts."
>
> "But you're not putting a spin on it or anything?"
>
> "Nope, it's the same story told in the original."
>
> "Huh. Sort of like..."
>
> "...a cover. Yeah."

I wish this were considered totally normal. For one thing, It would increase the number of competent writers. Many writers get discouraged when they struggle to generate original ideas, and quit early on. If writing covers were normal, beginning writers would be free to focus on developing their technique, which would better prepare them to execute on good ideas when they do come. Imagine if beginning musicians believed they shouldn't bother practicing their instruments unless each note they play is original. We might still have Beethoven, but would we have Yo-Yo Ma?

Moreover, there would be better, and more niche, versions of many written pieces. Imagine: *Jane Eyre*, covered by J.K. Rowling. *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, covered by Oprah. *Fifty Shades of Grey*, covered by Nabokov. *This is Water*, covered by Zadie Smith. *Into the Wild*, covered by Tolkien.

Such covers do exist, although not enough of them. A few months ago I tweeted about this idea, and Kevin Simler boosted it to his 16,000 followers, asking for examples. Here are some good ones that I found by reading the replies:

* Hunter S. Thompson covered parts of *The Great Gatsby*. According to Louis Menand's [obituary of Thompson](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/07/believer) in *The New Yorker*, Thompson "used to type out pages from *The Great Gatsby*, just to get the feeling, he said, of what it was like to write that way".
* Benjamin Franklin covered articles in the *Spectator*. He says in his [autobiography](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page06.htm), "I took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand.
* Visakan Veerasamy covered George Orwell's essay, "Politics and the English Language". He says in his introductory comment, "The following is my attempt to update George Orwell’s essay [Politics and the English Language [1946]](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/) for modern reading. I’ve tried to follow his own principles to make his words sharper and clearer where I can. This is meant as a supplement to the original essay, not a replacement."

There is another whole category of examples that exist almost by luck: translations. If it weren't for the fact that many of the greatest works of literature were composed in ancient languages, we might not get to enjoy them as much as we do. Nobody would be doing the hard work of updating the language for a modern audience. A few notable examples:

* *Beowulf*, translated by none other than J.R.R. Tolkien.
* *Tao Te Ching*, translated by Ursula K. Le Guin, the renowned science fiction writer.
* *The Odyssey*, translated by Emily Wilson. (Says Tyler Cowen, "It is a joy to read, the best of the five translations I know, and it has received [strong reviews](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=uyf5W6KdI87QrgS54pnQBQ&q=emily+wilson+homer+review&btnK=Google+Search&oq=emily+wilson+homer+review&gs_l=psy-ab.3...66238.70838..71982...0.0..0.0.0.......0....1..gws-wiz.....0.) from scholars for its accuracy and fidelity.")
