title: "Writing covers of other people's work"
description: What if it were common for writers to create "covers" of essays and books, the way musicians create covers of songs?

When an aspiring musician first learns to play an instrument, they don't immediately start composing their own songs. They first learn to play the songs of others. This allows them to focus on skills like intonation, modulating volume, and maintaining a consistent tempo. Skills like composition and lyricism can wait until the musician has developed good playing technique.

By contrast, an aspiring writer typically *does* create their own content right from the start. During their first struggles with skills like coherence, organization, and word choice, they also hold a high bar for ideation and originality. It's not that creating original content is an iron law, exactly. But writing is hard, and not many people bother to do it if they don't believe they're saying something new. I have never heard a conversation like this:

> "I'm working on a novel."
>
> "Cool, what's it about?"
>
> "It's *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*."
>
> "Oh, you mean like a fanfic?"
>
> "No, I'm just telling the story of Harry's first year at Hogwarts."
>
> "But you're not putting a spin on it or anything?"
>
> "Nope, it's the same as the story told in the original."
>
> "Word for word?"
>
> "No, but arc for arc. Rowling's story, my words."
>
> "Huh. Sort of like a cover."
>
> "Exactly!"

I wish writing covers were considered totally normal. I'm not talking about adaptations, like Joyce's *Ulysses* (an adaptation of The Odyssey, set in 20th century Dublin), although I would love to see more of those too. By "covers", I mean high-fidelity recreations of other people's written works—comprehensive paraphrases.

If writing covers were normal, fewer aspiring writers would give up on the craft. Many writers get discouraged when they struggle to find ideas, and don't even bother starting. An expectation of covers would allow these people to focus first on developing their technique, which would better prepare them to execute on good ideas when they do arrive.

Moreover, there would be better, and more niche, versions of many written works. Imagine: *Jane Eyre*, covered by Rowling. *On the Origin of Species*, covered by Dawkins. *Twilight*, covered by Atwood. Covers like these do exist, but too few. A few months ago I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1158132219484893184) about this idea, and Kevin Simler [boosted](https://twitter.com/KevinSimler/status/1158136084951261185) it to his 16,000 followers, asking for examples*. Here are some good ones:

* Hunter S. Thompson covered parts of *The Great Gatsby*. According to Louis Menand's [obituary of Thompson](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/07/believer) in *The New Yorker*, Thompson "used to type out pages from *The Great Gatsby*, just to get the feeling, he said, of what it was like to write that way".
* Benjamin Franklin covered articles in the *Spectator*. He says in his [autobiography](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page06.htm), "I took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand."
* Visakan Veerasamy [covered](http://www.visakanv.com/blog/politics-and-the-english-language/) George Orwell's essay, "Politics and the English Language". He says in his introductory comment, "The following is my attempt to update George Orwell’s essay [Politics and the English Language [1946]](http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/) for modern reading. I’ve tried to follow his own principles to make his words sharper and clearer where I can."

Look, I get it: we writers want to be recognized for our own ideas. And when the original source material is just a hyperlink away, why go to the trouble of paraphrasing it? Beyond the value of practice, the main reason is that by putting a set of ideas into [your own words](https://sivers.org/dq), you are giving readers a new set of mental handholds for them.

If you're struggling to keep up a regular blog, why not try writing covers of other people's blog posts for a while? I've been doing for the past few months. Here are a few examples:

* [Summary of Deep Laziness, by Sarah Perry](https://davidklaing.com/blog/summaries/2019/10/09/deep-laziness.html)
* [Summary of Solved Conversations, by Aaron Z. Lewis](https://davidklaing.com/blog/summaries/2019/10/23/solved-conversations.html)
* [Summary of Research as a Stochastic Decision Process, by Jacob Steinhardt](https://davidklaing.com/blog/summaries/2019/11/20/research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process.html)

It's been great exercise for my writing muscles, and I now have enough "original" ideas to last me several blog posts. Even if those ideas run dry, I don't have to worry about writer's block. If my own ideas aren't flowing, I can just cover someone else's.

*There is another whole category of examples that exist almost by luck: translations. If it weren't for the fact that many of the greatest works of literature were composed in ancient languages, we might not get to enjoy them as much as we do. Nobody would be doing the hard work of updating the language for a modern audience. A few notable examples:

* [*Beowulf*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf), translated by none other than J.R.R. Tolkien.
* [*Tao Te Ching*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39800574-ursula-k-le-guin-yorumuyla-tao-te-ching), translated by Ursula K. Le Guin, the renowned science fiction writer.
* [*The Odyssey*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068470-the-odyssey), translated by Emily Wilson. (Says Tyler Cowen, "It is a joy to read, the best of the five translations I know, and it has received [strong reviews](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=uyf5W6KdI87QrgS54pnQBQ&q=emily+wilson+homer+review&btnK=Google+Search&oq=emily+wilson+homer+review&gs_l=psy-ab.3...66238.70838..71982...0.0..0.0.0.......0....1..gws-wiz.....0.) from scholars for its accuracy and fidelity.")

Sadly, we will probably never get to read English "translations" of Austen or Dickens.
