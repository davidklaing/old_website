The definition that most of us have for the essay, whether we've thought actively about it before or not, is altogether quite simple and reasonable: an essay is a short piece of prose on a focused topic.

It's no great surprise that the essay is so pervasive in modern education, given that it's the perfect medium for displaying thought. Producing an essay requires no special tools or technical knowledge, and anybody with a basic grasp of language can do it if they try.

The French word for "try" ("essai") is in fact where we got the word "essay" from in the first place. In the late sixteenth century, a rather thoughtful and humble Frenchman called Michel de Montaigne published 107 short pieces which are now collectively know as his Essais. In these he mused on such riveting topics as smells, thumbs, and physiognomy.

Although Montaigne is generally considered the father of the modern essay, I think it would be unfair not to mention a few other members of the family tree.

Loving uncle number one is Francis Bacon, the English scientist and statesman of the sixteenth century who is also credited with fathering the scientific method (which means that the essay had a pretty awesome cousin). Bacon's essays were less digressive and thus a little bit less fun than Montaigne's, because he wrote more for his readers than for himself. But he is undeniably important.

Loving uncle number two is Samuel Johnson, another Englishman who was tremendously influential. Though he is not considered the father of anything in particular, his strongly opinionated writing provided enough avuncular nurture to the essay for him to deserve a mention here. He is also the subject of the most puzzled-looking portrait I have ever seen.

Jump back to around the year 1000, mosey over to Japan, and you'll find granny. Her name was Sei Shōnagon, and she was  an author and court lady most famous for writing The Pillow Book, a collection of observations and musings. The Japanese later called this literary genre zuihitsu, a term that is usually translated to mean "following the brush." Rather than plan their work intentionally, writers of zuihitsu would simply follow where their thoughts would take them.

Head on back to Pax Romana – the 200-year period of peace in the Roman Empire that came right after the birth of the Common Era – and look for the Greek biographer and historian Plutarch. He's another noted ancestor of the modern essay, having produced a whole book of them in his Moralia. He was a big inspiration to our friend Montaigne.

I could probably go on indefinitely in listing all those who produced precursors to the modern essay, but like Montaigne was wont to do, I digress. Hopefully by now I've done enough listing for you to believe me when I say that essays have been around in one form or another for thousands of years, all over the world.

None of this historical knowledge is necessary for writing better essays, but that doesn't mean it can't still be valuable. Knowing about the precedents of the form can help us dissect our own habits and expectations when dealing with the essay. This knowledge can also provide inspiration; if you're ever stuck, try reading some of the essays of those mentioned above. Montaigne's Essais is a good place to start.

Let's go a bit deeper, though, with help from Aldous Huxley, another famous essayist, and more famously the author of Brave New World. He thought that every essay exists somewhere within the realm of three "poles." To see this, imagine a triangle. One point represents personal and anecdotal writing, one point represents objective and empirical writing, and one point represents universal and abstract writing. Any given essay can fall anywhere within that triangle, favouring one or two or three of these poles. Huxley believed that the most engaging essays are the ones that fall smack-dab in the middle – the ones that include all three.

Not everyone would agree with Huxley, but I think I do. Including personal and anecdotal writing allows for the writer's voice and personality to come out, which has a humanizing effect on the essay. Including objective and empirical writing lends credibility to new insights and ideas, which helps the reader trust the writer. Including universal and abstract writing helps to piece together those insights and ideas in a broader context.

Unfortunately, in many of the circumstances in which we're tasked with writing an essay, we're taught to favour only the objective and empirical. Indeed, in an academic context, this is usually the only necessary component. But I wonder whether we're taught to ignore the personal and the universal because the three-pronged approach is difficult, perhaps impossible, for most beginning writers to pull off.

What do you think makes for a good essay? Is it just clear writing and a strong argument, or is it something more subtle than that?
