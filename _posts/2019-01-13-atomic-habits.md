In an episode of the North Star Podcast with David Perrell, the software entrepreneur Daniel Gross said something that I thought was very wise: "I think of a habit as anything you do that doesn't require conscious attention. I want to lock in my core habits by the time I'm 30, so that my conscious attention is free to deal with greater challenges."

I heard this a few weeks before the New Year, and got to thinking about which habits I might wish to develop or break in 2019. I found the perfect companion to this reflection in James Clear's new book, [Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Break Bad Habits & Build Good Ones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits).

The motivating idea behind the book is that habits are the compound interest of behaviour. In a given domain, someone who gets 1% better each day will rarely notice a change on any given day, but by the end of a year they will be 38% better than when they started. ($1.01^{365} = 37.8​$.) It's often not possible or useful to try to quantify your skill level—maybe you just want to remember to floss—but the insight is that huge long-term differences can be born of barely perceptible short-term differences. Hence, *atomic* habits: the building blocks of a better future.

Clear explains that all habits, good or bad, play out in four stages:

1. The **cue**. You perceive a specific signal. You see cookies on the kitchen table.
2. The **craving**. You feel a rush of desire for a specific reward. Your mouth starts watering as you imagine the chocolate chips melting in your mouth.
3. The **response**. You perform an action. You pick up a cookie and bite into it.
4. The **reward**. You experience pleasure as your desire is satisfied. Your taste buds send gushing thank-you notes up to your brain.

Each stage of this cycle is a lever you can pull. To build a good habit, pull them one way; to break a bad one, pull them the other way. This is Clear's method.

| Stage    | To build a good habit | To break a bad one   |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Cue      | Make it obvious       | Make it invisible    |
| Craving  | Make it attractive    | Make it unattractive |
| Response | Make it easy          | Make it hard         |
| Reward   | Make it satisfying    | Make it unsatisfying |



Useful concepts to share:

- the compound interest of self-improvement
- implementation intentions
  - example of how I'm using this in my daily work, especially for non-habitual tasks
- habit stacking
  - example of how I've used this to drink more water
- preparing space for its next use
  - example of how I've used this idea to prepare for biking, etc
- make it small
  - example of how I've made many of my habits smaller
- automate it
  - examples of things I've automated since reading the book
