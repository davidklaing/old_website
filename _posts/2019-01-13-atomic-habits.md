In an episode of the North Star Podcast with David Perrell, the software entrepreneur Daniel Gross said something that I thought was very wise: "I think of a habit as anything you do that doesn't require conscious attention. I want to lock in my core habits by the time I'm 30, so that my conscious attention is free to deal with greater challenges."

I heard this a few weeks before the New Year, and got to thinking about which habits I might wish to develop or break in 2019. I found the perfect companion to this reflection in James Clear's new book, [Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Break Bad Habits & Build Good Ones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits).

The motivating idea behind the book is that habits are the compound interest of behaviour. Get 1% better each day and you'll rarely notice a change on any given day, but by the end of a year you will be 38% better than when you started. ($1.01^{365} = 37.8$.) It's often not possible or useful to try to quantify your skill level—maybe you just want to remember to floss—but the insight is that huge long-term differences can be born from barely perceptible short-term differences. Hence, *atomic* habits: the building blocks of a better future.

Clear explains that all habits, good or bad, play out in four stages:

1. The **cue**. You perceive a specific signal. You see cookies on the kitchen table.
2. The **craving**. You feel a rush of desire for a specific reward. Your mouth starts watering as you imagine the chocolate chips melting in your mouth.
3. The **response**. You perform an action. You pick up a cookie and bite into it.
4. The **reward**. You experience pleasure as your desire is satisfied. Your taste buds send gushing thank-you notes up to your brain.

Each stage of this cycle is a lever you can pull. To build a good habit, pull them one way; to break a bad one, pull them the other way. This is the essence of Clear's method.

| Stage    | To build a good habit | To break a bad one   |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Cue      | Make it obvious       | Make it invisible    |
| Craving  | Make it attractive    | Make it unattractive |
| Response | Make it easy          | Make it hard         |
| Reward   | Make it satisfying    | Make it unsatisfying |

The book is broken into four sections, one for each stage of the habit cycle. Each chapter begins with a short vignette about a historical figure, and then dives into a related piece of advice. If you've done some thinking or reading about habit formation before, then some of these chapters might be about ideas you're familiar with already; this was the case for me. However, even if you feel like you know the landscape well, I expect that you would find at least one actionable idea in the book. For the rest of this post, I'll describe the ideas that I've implemented myself.

### Habit stacking

One of the easiest ways to build a new habit is to attach it to an existing one. By resolving to perform a new behaviour after another that is already occuring, you turn the existing habit's reward into the new habit's cue; you make it obvious. After enough repetitions, the new habit is woven right into your life.

Last year I developed a stable habit of doing push-ups and kettlebell swings after every 25-minute work block throughout my workday. When I read about habit stacking, I recognized an opportunity to use these existing habits as foundations for a new one I've been meaning to develop: drinking more water. Now, every time I do my push-ups and kettlebell swings, I drink a small glass of water. It's fair to say that I'm better hydrated than ever before.

### Implementation intentions

A study found that between two treatment groups who made to-do lists, the people in one group accomplished many more tasks than those in the other. It was the people who were told to include with each task the time and location when they intended to complete it. They created an *implementation intention*. This is another way to make a behaviour more obvious.

I've started writing down implementation intentions every time I add an item to my to-do list. Instead of *Call the bank to order a new debit card*, it's *Call the bank to order a new debit card in the living room on Saturday morning*. While there are still plenty of overdue tasks on my to-do list, this new habit of writing down where and when I intend to complete each task seems to have greatly increased the probability that I'll actually do them.

### Priming a space for its next use

Another way to make a behaviour easy is to arrange the space where that behaviour will occur 

### Make it small



### Automate it



Useful concepts to share:

- the compound interest of self-improvement
- implementation intentions
  - example of how I'm using this in my daily work, especially for non-habitual tasks
- habit stacking
  - example of how I've used this to drink more water
- preparing space for its next use
  - example of how I've used this idea to prepare for biking, etc
- make it small
  - example of how I've made many of my habits smaller
- automate it
  - examples of things I've automated since reading the book
