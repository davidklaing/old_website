Lots of people aspire to do a "personal master's degree," but I've never seen anyone describe an attempt to do a "personal PhD." With the caveat that I haven't done or started a PhD myself, it appears to me that many components of a PhD are achievable outside a PhD program. I think people who are drawn to PhD programs should consider whether they can assemble the key ingredients on their own.

As far as I can tell, these are the key ingredients:

1. A broad understanding of the history and methods of your discipline, and a deep, constantly renewing understanding of a specialty within that discipline.
2. Several peer-reviewed publications.
3. Frequent feedback from an expert mentor of a period of several years.
4. Extensive experience teaching and evaluating beginners.
5. Completion and publication of a large research project that makes an original contribution.

None of these things are easy to do outside a PhD program, but they're all possible. You can learn independently: materials are abundant and usually free, so in many disciplines the only barriers to understanding are time and discipline. You can publish papers in industry journals or conference proceedings. You can find an expert mentor. You can volunteer to lead workshops, or find a part-time teaching position. And as long as you can acquire the tools and the data, you can do original research.

With all this in mind, people consider doing PhDs for different reasons. Perhaps you want it as a stepping-stone to a better industry job. Perhaps you want to become a tenured professor. Perhaps you are simply captivated by a problem and can't bear to be distracted from it. Or perhaps you are attracted to the idea of knowing something—anything—with incredible depth.

That last one is me, I think. So maybe I can mainly forego the publications, the teaching, the mentorship in order to focus on ingredient number 1: learning. I feel compelled by a thought someone recently shared on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In May of 2019, at the end the 2nd year of my PhD, I set a 10 year goal to spend 10^4 hours thinking about categorical homotopy theory. By my imperfect accounting, I made it just in time to celebrate the very welcome news that I'll get to stay @JHUmath for the foreseeable future.</p>&mdash; Emily Riehl (@emilyriehl) <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyriehl/status/1147277219787608064">December 16, 2018</a></blockquote>

Imagine that! 10,000 hours thinking about [insert speciality here]. Imagine taking that goal seriously, and tracking those hours.

It's a long road to true expertise, and I doubt I could follow it. I'm surely too distractible by the vast number of interesting forks to take off that road. But there is some comfort in knowing that such roads are there, and we're free to take them at our own pace.
