One of the main topics in productivity and self-improvement is the asymmetry between present and future utilities. On one side of the asymmetry, enjoying the present often costs you a harder future: ice cream tastes great now, but it makes you fat later. On the other side, an easier future often costs you a less decadent present: you can stay slim, but only if you don't eat too much ice cream.

I noticed recently that there are two main schools of thought about how to address this asymmetry, so I'm brazenly giving them names.

## Sisypheanism

The **Sisyphean** approach, named after the Greek figure who was doomed to push a boulder up a hill forever, is to **embrace** the asymmetry. The best things in life come from effort, so get used to being effortful. Train yourself to tolerate suffering in the present so that you can enjoy a better future. The less you indulge, the stronger you become. No pain no gain. The good stuff is upstream, so get swimming.

Here are some tweets I've seen recently that express Sisyphean views:

## Proteanism

The **Protean** approach, named after the Greek god who could predict the future but would change his shape to avoid having to, is to **equalize** the asymmetry. The greater the difference between what you should do and what you want to do, the less you will do what you should. Make your investments more pleasurable and your indulgences less costly. Redirect the flow, then go with it.

Or should you structure your life so that you can hit minimal targets on minimal effort, optimizing for high energy, cancelling anything you dread?
