The other day I was perusing the website of a writers' association, and on the FAQ page I read a very funny question that went something like this:

"I have a lot of great ideas for stories, but I'm just not a writer. How do I find someone who will write my books for me and then split the profits?"

Dear frequent asker of this question: good luck! Dear everyone else: let's get to work. Our job is to turn the conceit – the shortest, truest possible answer to the what's-it-about question – into a full-grown story. It is no easy task, but it is very personal and very worth it. That's why you've never heard of a book that was written by one person but conceived of by another.

Recall (gosh, now I sound like a math textbook): a story is "an entertaining, informative, or instructional recounting of a series of causally related events, either factual or imaginary, that are arranged or organized so as to produce informational tension, and that include one or more agents that change or are changed by their environment." ([me](https://davidklaing.com/blog/2014/06/27/what-is-a-story.html), 2014)

How do we turn our cute little conceit into that monstrosity? Well, part of the beauty of writing is that the process will be different for everybody. Some writers like to plan every little detail before writing the first word, while others prefer to write by the seat of their pants. I'm usually more of the former. I probably have less fun than the seat-of-pants writers, but that's just how it is.

Whichever side of the spectrum you find yourself on, by the time you're done writing your story, it will have a plot. It will have a spine that can be laid out on the table to be looked at. The reason I tend to do a fair bit of planning before I write a story is that I want to make sure that that spine has all its vertebrae. You don't have to do the same, but it may still be useful to know some mythological spinal anatomy.

The basic parts are pretty straightforward. You probably learned them in grade school. They look like this:

> _Exposition_. Welcome to a world that is different from yours.
> 
> _Inciting incident_. Something happens in it.
> 
> _Rising action_. More things happen as a result.
> 
> _Climax_. Something really important happens.
> 
> _Falling action_. A few more things happen as a result of that important thing.
> 
> _Denouement_. Oh, so that's why all those things happened.

(Isn't 'denouement' a delightful word? It's French; it means 'unknotting.')

The vast majority of stories have all or most of these six parts, but that doesn't mean that all of their dimensions and arrangements are always the same. Like with arguments – and I swear I'm not making up these parallels – there are two main types of plots: linear and cyclical. Both have narrative arcs that may follow similar curves; the difference is where they end up.

The denouement in a linear plot will be at some distance away from the exposition, as it is in Romeo and Juliet. I won't spoil the ending for any of you who haven't read or seen it, but I will say that the eponymous lovers are in a very different state by the end of the play than they were at the beginning. The narrative arc looks like a rainbow. (In Romeo and Juliet, a very gloomy one).

In contrast, the denouement in a cyclical plot will join up with the exposition. The most extreme example of this is probably James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, whose opening line is a sentence fragment that is a continuation of its closing line, which is left unfinished. Of course, the cyclicality goes deeper than the level of language. Many if not most of these plots follow a pattern called the "monomyth," or the "hero's journey."  The word "monomyth" actually comes directly from Finnegans Wake (which, incidentally, also marked the first use of the word "wordpress"!). The monomyth is the subject of Joseph Campbell's hugely influential book, published in 1949, [The Hero With a Thousand Faces](https://www.amazon.ca/Hero-Thousand-Faces-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936). It describes and explores a mythological pattern that seems to crop up in every culture and every era. It's summarized in the following statement:

> "A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man."

We see it in Harry Potter and Luke Skywalker and Katniss Everdeen and countless others. I won't go into more detail than the statement above; I wouldn't know where to stop, and Campbell wrote a whole book about it, after all. I've read about a quarter of it so far, and already I feel confident recommending it to any aspiring storyteller.

But don't rush to the bookstore yet, because that recommendation comes with a caveat that I will have to wait until next week to explain. The first reason for this is that the caveat relates more to the story's strength (or its aesthetic power as art – which is next week's topic) than to its anatomy, and the second is that I'm trying to keep each post on the snappy side of 1000 words.

Next week is exciting, though, at least for me. I'm going to be drawing again from Joyce and Campbell, as well as from a private-school teacher called Paul Lockhart, who once wrote a beautiful essay about the art form that you never knew was an art form: mathematics.
