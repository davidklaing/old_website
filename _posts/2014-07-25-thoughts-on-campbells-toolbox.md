Last week I told you about Joseph Campbell's unravelling of what is probably the most prevalent pattern in myth, which he called the hero's journey. I told you that the book he wrote about this pattern, [The Hero With A Thousand Faces](https://www.amazon.ca/Hero-Thousand-Faces-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936), is recommended reading for any aspiring storyteller. But there was a but.

The but is nicely demonstrated in a quotation from the essay that I mentioned last week, [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf), whose author, Paul Lockhart, probably never even dreamed of being mentioned on a blog as well-read as mine. Good thing I try to help out the little people. Here he is:

> "To tell you the truth, most students just aren’t very good at music. They are bored in class, their skills are terrible, and their homework is barely legible. Most of them couldn’t care less about how important music is in today’s world; they just want to take the minimum number of music courses and be done with it. I guess there are just music people and non-music people. I had this one kid, though, man was she sensational! Her sheets were impeccable— every note in the right place, perfect calligraphy, sharps, flats, just beautiful. She’s going to make one hell of a musician someday."

Just to clarify for those of you who didn't pause for an hour to read his (truly brilliant) essay, Lockhart is parodying math education by imagining what it would be like if music education were the same. How horrible would that be, how torturous, if we forced children to swallow and vomit twelve years worth of music theory before ever allowing them to touch an instrument?

Okay, so that's an interesting analogy. But how is it connected to Joseph Campbell and whether or not you should read his book? Well, now I'll be a bit more forthright, this time by quoting fantasy author Neil Gaiman:

"I think I got about half way through The Hero with a Thousand Faces and found myself thinking, if this is true — I don’t want to know. I really would rather not know this stuff. I’d rather do it because it’s true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is."

Hopefully this has made the connection clearer for you. I hesitate to recommend Campbell's book unconditionally to someone who has an interest in being a creator of stories because I think there is something very valuable in the experience of creating a work of art 'from scratch.' In some sense, that becomes harder to do when you're bogged down by a bunch of theory, even if that theory is extremely useful. It's like being given a brand new toolbox; you'll use it, and it will help you do your job well, but you'll never even have to think about creating and using tools of your own invention. If you decide to learn about somebody else's theories of storytelling, even if they're enlightening and empowering, you may run the risk of depersonalizing your own creative process, in the same way that most educational systems have made it so that most students will never feel the ecstasy of what it's like to do real mathematics. I'm not advising a complete neglect of process—otherwise, there wouldn't be much point in reading my blog—I'm just saying that sometimes it can be way harder to think outside the box when the box is full of awesome tools. For the time being, I've paused my reading of that particular Campbell book.
