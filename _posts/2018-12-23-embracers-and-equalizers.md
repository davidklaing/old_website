One of the main topics in productivity and self-improvement is the asymmetry between present and future utilities. On one side of the asymmetry, enjoying the present often costs you a harder future: ice cream tastes great now, but it makes you fat later. On the other side, an easier future often costs you a less decadent present: you can stay slim, but only if you don't eat too much ice cream.

I noticed recently that there are two main schools of thought about how to address this asymmetry, so I'm giving them names.

## Embracers

The first approach is to **embrace** the asymmetry. The best things in life come from effort, so get used to being effortful. Train yourself to tolerate suffering in the present so that you can enjoy a better future. The less you indulge, the stronger you become. Swim upstream.

Here are some tweets I've seen recently that express embracer views:

## Equalizers

The second approach is to **equalize** the asymmetry. The greater the difference between what you should do and what you want to do, the less you will do what you should. Make your investments more pleasurable and your indulgences less costly. Redirect the flow, then go with it.
