Some people don't know when to shut up. They happily monopolize conversations, paying little attention to the wandering eyes of those in their audience.

These blabbermouths are the extreme sinners, but few of us are perfect. It's not easy to strike the perfect balance between speaking and listening, and even when we do, we're often still more interested in our own thoughts than in those of others. Accordingly, there is a robust thread of social wisdom that says "listen more than you speak", which thankfully prevents most of us from being too obnoxious.

But I think many of us swing too far in the direction of silence, and underappreciate the virtue of speaking our minds.

Okay, it's time to start writing about the semi-epiphany that I had after Borlaug Camp: the virtue of talking more / speaking up. The main point of revelation for me was when playing Avalon, when I was on the good team and I was being too silent. This was a valuable lesson to me. The idea was that bad people find it hard to talk lots because they need to be careful not to reveal their hidden information. And good people need to talk a lot to distinguish themselves from the bad people, and also to help the rest of the group figure things out. This same lesson came from Julia Galef's session on how / why to have unpopular opinions, where she made the point that it's okay to simultaneously hold both an inside view and an outside view, and that it's part of your duty to the epistemic commons to share your inside view. I suppose I could run some sort of simulation if I wanted to demonstrate this idea. But maybe that would be overkill. The main thing right now is to just to figure out: what is my thesis? And what are the ideas that support it? Is this going to be a convergent argument? Or the other kind? (Can't remember the name.) I suppose I should organize it around understanding the convergent premises. But then again, maybe this should just be a sort of reflection on the virtue itself. Maybe that doesn't require any actual argumentation. Anyway, that's the first step: understanding my thesis and the main supporting points, as well as any other ideas I want to convey.

Thesis: sharing your thoughts is an underappreciated virtue.

Premises:

- Silence breeds suspicion.
- Silence is slow.
- Sharing is edifying, especially when you're wrong.
- Sharing helps you decouple your inside view from your omniscient view.
- There is no wisdom in the crowd if everyone is listening for that wisdom but not adding to it.
- You don't have to win to shape the discourse or the outcome.
- Understanding others is important, but it's overvalued as wise advice, especially compared with making your own views as understandable as possible
- It's hard to make your views understandable; you will inevitably reveal inconsistencies the more honestly you play
- Your uncertainty is valuable information



Title: "If you're good, you need to talk more"

One evening last fall, I was invited to join a group of ten people to play a board game called Avalon. The game is a contest between two teams: good and bad. The catch is that the bad people, who know each other's identities, are pretending to be good, so the good people, who know only their own identities, don't know who they can trust. At each turn, one person proposes a subset of players to go on a mission, and that subset is approved or denied by a majority vote by all players. If the subset is approved, then each person in the subset anonymously votes to pass or fail the mission. If there is even a single failure, then the mission fails. By the end of many rounds, if there are more failed missions than successful ones, the bad team wins. Otherwise, the good team wins. The bad people try to get themselves chosen for the missions, in order to fail them, and the good people try to prevent this at all costs.

The setup is simple, but within minutes the gameplay is dizzying. As a bad player, you have good information: you look out on the group and you know exactly which players are lying. But you can't reveal that you know this, lest you undermine their identities or your own. Indeed, the only way to protect this information is to speak and act as if you know only that you yourself are good. As a good player, you have limited information: you know that some people out there are coordinating to deceive you, but not much else. The only resources you have are your eyes, your ears, your voice, and your votes.

When I played Avalon that evening, I was assigned to the good team. I was the only one in the group who had never played before, and barely knew any of the other people, who all knew each other quite well. Because of this, I took a backseat for the first few rounds, speaking very little. To my surprise, this caused many players to strongly suspect that I was bad.

"If you're good," [one of them]([http://kwokchain.com/](http://kwokchain.com/)) said to me, "you need to talk more."

I protested that bad people can speak just as easily as good people. How could my words engender trust when any word I said might be a lie?

What I failed to understand was that because of the burden of deception, talking is much more cognitively demanding for bad people than it is for good people. It's hard to maintain a consistent lie over the course of the whole game. This means that the best strategy for those on the good team is to consistently share their own thoughts and solicit those of all others. The game will be easiest for the good team if every player is expected to regularly give a clear account of their identity, their observations, and their reasoning. Conversely, the game will be easiest for the bad team without this norm of openness.

*If you're good, you need to talk more.* I've thought a lot about this idea in the past six months. It seems to me that sharing your thoughts is an under-appreciated virtue, and that it is especially important when it feels the most unnatural: when you are uncertain, when you feel uninformed, or when you disagree with the consensus.
