# Trajectories for 2020

**Piano.** üÜï I've played the guitar since I was a kid, but haven't felt as excited about it in the past few years. I've always wanted to learn the piano, so I hope this will be a fun new challenge. By the end of 2020 I would like to be able to learn a random pop song by ear in under an hour.

**Note-taking.** üÜï After reading S√∂nke Ahrens' book [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3085392000), I want to give the slip-box method a test drive. By April 1st I would like to have written 60 literature notes and 30 permanent notes. I'll reassess my trajectory at that point.

**Goal-setting & monthly/quarterly reviews.** ‚ÜóÔ∏è In the second half of 2019 I got in the swing of doing weekly reviews, but haven't habitually done monthly or quarterly reviews, or completed any significant side projects. In 2020 I would like to do this consistently. To that end, I'll share concrete quarterly goals on my "[/now](https://davidklaing.com/now)" page on April 1st, July 1st, and September 1st, and where relevant I will update any progress trackers every month.

**Blogging.** ‚ÜóÔ∏è In 2019 I published 7 blog posts, for a total of 6700 words. By the end of 2020 I would like to have published 15,000 words, an average of 1250 every month.

**Reading books.** ‚ÜóÔ∏è In 2019 I finished six books, and read parts of around 6 more. I estimate that I read about 3500 pages.  Reading isn't a race, but I'm happier the more time I spend reading books, so in 2020 I'm going to shoot for 5000 pages, an average of 400 every month.

**Time with friends**. ‚ÜóÔ∏è In 2019 I barely ever called my friends, and only spent a few quality weekends with them. In 2020 I'm going reach out to my friends more, and plan more trips and experiences with the ones who live nearby. I'm also going to try to meet more internet friends in person than I did this year (two).

**Local/regional travel & exploration.** ‚ÜóÔ∏è In 2019 I did a good amount of this‚Äîwent to Squamish, Nelson, Deep Cove, Salt Spring Island, and Victoria. In 2020 I'd like to do even more, ideally with friends.

**Newsletter.** ‚û°Ô∏è I started my newsletter on August 15th 2019, and I sent one issue per week for 19 weeks straight, taking a one-week break during the Christmas holidays. In 2020 I plan to keep the same schedule, with perhaps one additional buffer week at some point, for a total of 50 issues.

**Twitter.** ‚û°Ô∏è In 2019 I spent much more time on Twitter than ever before, especially after publishing [If you're good, you need to talk more](https://davidklaing.com/blog/2019/07/09/talk-more.html). I plan to continue using it as much as I have been, but won't be too heavy-handed with myself if I feel like ramping up or down throughout the year.

**Bouldering.** ‚û°Ô∏è I started bouldering about six months ago and it's the most fun I've had while exercising in years. Unless something significant changes, I plan to go the bouldering gym at least 100 times in 2020.

**Python skill development.** ‚û°Ô∏è In December I started a subscription to [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/), a service for learning and practicing pythonic programming. Unless the service declines in quality, or unless it no longer seems valuable to me, I plan to attempt 50 practice problems throughout 2020.

**Chess.** ‚ÜòÔ∏è For better or worse, 2019 was my year of obsession with chess. In 2020 I want to continue playing, but much less. I'll start by committing to never playing for more than 20 minutes a day before April 1st.

**Plane travel.** ‚ÜòÔ∏è In 2019 I boarded a grand total of 18 planes. It was expensive and often exhausting, never mind the massive carbon footprint. In 2020 I would like to visit Ontario fewer times and take vacations that require only car or train travel.


# 4. Things that defined my year

## Media

### Books

#### Finished

**S√∂nke Ahrens, [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3085392000)**. An introduction to the Zettlekasten (or "slip box") method of notetaking, invented by the sociologist Niklas Luhmann. Recommended to anyone who is serious about writing or learning.

**Larry McMurtry, [Lonesome Dove](goodreads.com/review/show/2818515061)**. The best novel I've read in years. The characters walk right off the page. Highly recommended to anyone and everyone.

**Robert Caro, [The Path to Power](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86524.The_Path_to_Power)**. First volume in Caro's decade-spanning, multi-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson. The biographical equivalent of Breaking Bad or House of Cards, except it actually happened.

**N.K. Jemisin, [The Fifth Season](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161852-the-fifth-season)**. I haven't read much fantasy in the past decade, but I think this qualifies as a fresh take on the genre. Recommended to anyone who likes fantasy, but personally I don't plan to read the next book in the series.

**Tara Westover, [Educated](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37930892-educated)**. Haunting memoir of a woman who was homeschooled... sort of. Beautifully written, and engaging throughout. Recommended to anyone.

**James Clear, [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2674765726)**. A quick, useful read about habit formation. A bit too heavy on the anecdotes, but they can be skipped, and the rest is great. Recommended to anyone who has made it this far into my annual review.. üòÜ

#### Made a good dent

**William Finnegan, [Barbarian Days](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2954913394)**. A compelling portrait of an obsession with surfing, but I lost interest about halfway through.

**Ted Chiang, [Exhalation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41160292-exhalation)**. Incredible collection of sci-fi short stories. I read several of them, and plan to read more. If you want a taste, I highly recommend [The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling](https://web.archive.org/web/20140222103103/http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang).

#### Abandoned

**Bill Browder, [Red Notice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24811910-red-notice)**. Memoir of an investor who makes a lot of money in Russia and then gets into some trouble. I only made it about a quarter of the way in‚Äîperhaps it gets more interesting later, but I'll never know. (I started reading it for a book club.)

**Neil Stephenson, [Snow Crash](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883-snow-crash)**. A sci-fi classic, but just didn't do it for me.

### Articles

**[One-Touch to Inbox Zero](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/one-touch-to-inbox-zero-a74cfa02e5bf/), by Tiago Forte.** I read this article in July, and it changed the course of my year. It helped me to create better habits around my email inbox, which caused me to start using a task management app, a read-it-later app, and a note-taking app. These systems in turn gave me the confidence to start writing my newsletter, which created other positive feedback loops.

**[Why books don't work](https://andymatuschak.org/books/), by Andy Matuschak.** Reading informational non-fiction is an ineffective way to learn. 

**[Making Knowledge Work Visible](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/making-knowledge-work-visible/), by Tasshin Fogleman.** There is a middle ground between staying completely focused on one project at a time and flitting aimlessly among dozens.

**[Theory of Constraints 101](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/theory-of-constraints-101-2d4d9cf1916a/), by Tiago Forte.** To increase the throughput of a system, you need to increase the throughput at its tightest bottleneck.

**[Deep Laziness](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/04/06/deep-laziness/), by Sarah Perry.** Find activities and behaviors that resonate with the core of your being, then elaborate on them to create still deeper resonance.

**[always bet on text](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html), by graydon2.** It's fine to focus your creative energy on text rather than other forms of media.

**[The Tyranny of Ideas](https://nadiaeghbal.com/ideas), by Nadia Eghbal.** What if people don't have ideas, but ideas have people?

**[Status as a Service](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service), by Eugene Wei.** Social media companies make money off ads, but what they provide to users is an efficient means of acquiring social status.

**[Going Critical](https://meltingasphalt.com/going-critical/), by Kevin Simler.** An intuition pump for how networks thrive or die.

### Videos

**[A Very Vulfy Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czj01VhbEwM), by Woody Goss.**
