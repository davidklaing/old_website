I've only ever gotten mildly excited while sitting in the bathtub.

This is the main thing that distinguishes me from the ancient Greek scholar known as Archimedes, who once got so happy in the tub that he couldn't help but urgently leave to go running naked through the streets. He'd just realized that the volume of an object could be determined by the amount of water it displaces, and so, with what I'm sure was no negligible displacement of bathwater, he jumped up and yelled "Eureka!"

We now use the word to describe a moment of insight or inspiration. Probably the most famous Eureka moment is the one that resulted in Newton's laws of gravitation, which supposedly came to dear Isaac when a falling apple collided with his head. Less famous and significantly less apocryphal is the story of the origin of The Beatles' song "Yesterday," which went on to become the most covered song in history: the melody came to Paul McCartney in a dream. Vince Gilligan got the idea for Breaking Bad while he and a friend were joking about giving up on writing and cooking meth instead.

Clearly, a good Eureka moment is what any sensible aspiring writer should pray for. From all these stories we keep hearing about unplanned flashes of insight, it seems like the easiest way to create something really good is to just sit under an apple tree and wait for a bonk on the head.

But sensible aspiring writers also tend to spend at least a little bit of time seeking advice about how to become better at writing, and the piece of advice that they come across most often is this: stop waiting and start writing.

I'm surely not the only writer who gets stressed out by the knowledge that I should be writing even when I don't feel like I've got a good enough idea for a project to warrant investing a lot of time and effort into it. I like to have a pretty clear idea of how a story is going to play out before I actually start writing it, and so there are times when I get stuck for far too long in the idea-gathering stage, which is to say that I spend too long staring at ceilings, floors, walls, and inanimate objects while I try to force my brain to offer up a Eureka moment. It never seems to work.

American author Louis L'Amour provides a slightly fuller version of the common wisdom: "Start writing, no matter what. The water does not flow until the faucet is turned on." I like this analogy because it accounts for the fact that most Eureka moments are not as spontaneous as they appear. Look at it this way: it wasn't Isaac Newton, the scientist, who dreamt up a catchy jazz melody (as far as we know), and it wasn't Paul McCartney, the musician, who suddenly understood how to operationalize the equations of classical mechanics. Likewise, it should come as no surprise that the idea for a story like Breaking Bad happened to stroll into the mind of Vince Gilligan, a writer. The point is that all of these successful people got their Eureka moments after thousands of hours of work in their respective disciplines.

So I think the solution to my problem is fairly clear. I need to forget all about waiting for a Eureka moment and just start writing. Of course, that doesn't mean I shouldn't make myself ready for a moment if it comes. That's why I keep a notebook by my bed and another in my knapsack. That's why I read a little bit every day. That's why I try to say 'yes' to as many invitations and opportunities as I can manage, often to my utter exhaustion, just in case the exposure to a new environment or experience happens to provide the flash of insight that I need.

But none of these extra measures will matter at all if I don't actually practice the craft. So here I am, typing away.

Do you struggle with finding inspiration for your writing? What do you do to keep yourself open to the possibility of having a Eureka moment?
