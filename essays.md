My 'essays' are standalone pieces of writing that make an argument or describe an insight that isn't necessarily tied to a particular topic. For my other writing see my [notes](https://www.davidklaing.com/notes), which include book reviews, article commentaries, media recommendations, how-to's, and other reference material.
