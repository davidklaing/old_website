E.M. Forster's short story *[The Machine Stops](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4711854-the-machine-stops)*, published in 1909, gives an eerily prescient account of life in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's a short read—about an hour—but it's packed with passages that made my jaw drop for how specifically they describe our situation. Much like a Black Mirror episode, it imagines taking aspects of modern life taken to the extreme. But unlike a Black Mirror episode, it was written over a hundred years ago. It's hard not to wonder whether *The Machine Stops* will become more and more prophetic in years to come. What, exactly, does Forster predict? And how have those predictions turned out so far?

## Forster predicts self-isolation.

The story takes place in a world where everyone lives in the Machine, a massive underground human beehive that offers protection from the toxic air on the Earth's surface. Every person lives alone in a hexagonal room through which the Machine provides their every need: food, entertainment, medical care, and the ability to communicate with others via video chats. People spend their days giving and attending virtual lectures; the more upstanding citizens of the world are above all concerned with producing "ideas".

The main character is Vashti, a woman who enjoys her life in the Machine and doesn't question it. Her daily routine is frighteningly similar to my own at the moment:

> She made the room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light; she ate and exchanged ideas with her friends, and listened to music and attended lectures; she make the room dark and slept. Above her, beneath her, and around her, the Machine hummed eternally; she did not notice the noise, for she had been born with it in her ears. The earth, carrying her, hummed as it sped through silence, turning her now to the invisible sun, now to the invisible stars. She awoke and made the room light.

Of course, we still go outside, and not all of us live alone. But most of us do spend close to 24 hours a day in the same set of rooms, and enjoy complete control over both our physical and digital environments. Forster wouldn't have used the phrase "digital environment", since he wrote this decades before the invention of the transistor, let alone the rise of personal computing and social media. But if he were alive today, it's clear that he would be unphased by the prevalence of podcasts, YouTube, Twitter, and online courses.

## Forster predicts the end of originality.

We learn from one of Vashti's lecturers that not all ideas are equally valued:

> “Beware of first-hand ideas!” exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. “First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by love and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing element—direct observation."

I probably don't need to point out the irony of the context in which you're reading *these* ideas. If you're familiar with my writing, you know that I'm not merely a participant in the culture of [everything being a remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc); I'm a [perpetuator](https://davidklaing.com/essays/covers-shouldnt-just-be-for-musicians) of it.

## Forster predicts the ubiquity, and the inadequacy, of video conferencing.

Vashti receives a call from her son, who wants her to come visit him in person. She initially refuses, telling him that it would be a waste of time. She would rather stay in her room and focus on producing ideas. Besides, why speak in person when they could communicate perfectly well through the Machine?

But her son is persistent, and even Vashti observes that "the Machine did not transmit nuances of expression [...] it only gave a general idea of people - an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes." When giving a lecture, her audience "heard her, fairly well, and saw her, fairly well."

Anyone who has used Zoom knows that this paints an almost comically accurate picture of modern video conferencing software. While it's getting better every year, and while VR/AR may soon help to smooth out some of the kinks, video conferencing remains frustratingly low-bandwidth, relative to in-person communication. It doesn't allow eye contact; it cuts out if the internet connection is weak; it doesn't facilitate the use of 3-dimensional space. It's perfectly serviceable for all practical purposes. But at its best, it simply allows us to see each other, fairly well, and hear each other, fairly well.

## Forster predicts the end of geographic mobility.

Eventually Vashti agrees to visit her son. She leaves her room and begins her journey across through the Machine. People aren't forbidden from travelling, but few bother to do it:

> Thanks to the advance of science, the earth was exactly alike all over. [...] What was the good of going to Peking when it was just like Shrewsbury? Why return to Shrewsbury when it would all be like Peking? Men seldom moved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul.

I love to travel, but I will admit that after backpacking in Europe for a few months, the cities *did* start to look awfully familiar...check into the hostel, visit the art gallery, see the great big cathedral...

Tyler Cowen worries in his book [The Complacent Class](https://www.amazon.com/Complacent-Class-Self-Defeating-Quest-American/dp/1250108691) about how Americans are less and less likely to move away from their hometowns. He [writes in Time](https://time.com/4677919/tyler-cowen-book/) that "the interstate migration rate has fallen 51 percent below its 1948–1971 average, and that number has been falling steadily since the mid-1980s."

The travel restrictions caused by the pandemic won't last forever, but it's hard to see how the new normal would involve an *increase* in travel and mobility.

## Forster predicts social distancing norms.

Most of Vashti's journey takes place in an airship. At one point she is disturbed by a ray of sunlight that shines through the broken windowblinds in her cabin. She nearly faints from the horror of it. An attendant reaches out to catch her as she falls, which Vashti finds even more horrifying:

> “How dare you!” exclaimed [Vashti]. “You forget yourself!” [The attendant] was confused, and apologized for not having let her fall. People never touched one another. The custom had become obsolete, owing to the Machine.

Who knows how extreme this episode might appear, ten or twenty years from now? I'm not so pessimistic to think we'll never touch each other again, but it seems likely that e.g. handshakes and cheek kissing are now relics of history.

## Forster predicts complacency.

Later in the story, Vashti and her friends start to notice defects in the Machine. At first, the music doesn't sound as good—there is a "jarring noise" that occasionally interrupts it. Then the artificial fruit that they eat starts be served mouldy. Then the bath water begins to stink, and the "poetry machine" emits "defective rhymes". The worse things get, the more complacent the people become. All the problems are "bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse to unchallenged."

I don't think Forster would be surprised to learn about [slacktivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism).

## Forster predicts the end of the world.

In what I hope is the least prescient part of the story, the Machine does stop, and the world ends. All of Forster's descriptions of this event are vivid and haunting, but one in particular stood out:

> The sin against the body—it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of wrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by which we can alone apprehend—glozing it over with talk of evolution, until the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last sloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars.

There is no denying that compared to the lives of our ancestors, ours are far less gritty, less embodied. Am I still part of that spirit that grasped the stars? Or am I white pap? Well, today I spent ten hours reclining on my La-Z-boy, listening to music, messaging with friends, producing second-hand ideas. It's almost time to make the room dark.
