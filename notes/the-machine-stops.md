E.M. Forster's short story *[The Machine Stops](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4711854-the-machine-stops)*, published in 1909, gives an eerily prescient account of life in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's a short read—about an hour—but it's packed with passages that made my jaw drop for how specifically they describe our situation. Much like a Black Mirror episode, it imagines modern life taken to the extreme. But unlike a Black Mirror episode, it was written over a hundred years ago. It's hard not to wonder whether *The Machine Stops* will become more and more prophetic in years to come. What, exactly, does Forster predict?

**He predicts self-isolation.**

The story takes place in a world where everyone lives in the Machine, a massive underground human beehive that offers protection from the toxic air on the Earth's surface. Every person lives alone in a hexagonal room through which the Machine provides their every need: food, entertainment, medical care, and the ability to communicate with others via video chats. People spend their days giving and attending virtual lectures; the more upstanding citizens of the world are above all concerned with producing "ideas".

The main character is Vashti, a woman who enjoys her life in the Machine and doesn't question it. Her life is this:

> She made the room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light; she ate and exchanged ideas with her friends, and listened to music and attended lectures; she make the room dark and slept. Above her, beneath her, and around her, the Machine hummed eternally; she did not notice the noise, for she had been born with it in her ears. The earth, carrying her, hummed as it sped through silence, turning her now to the invisible sun, now to the invisible stars. She awoke and made the room light.

**He predicts the ubiquity, and the inadequacy, of telecommunication.**

One day, Vashti receives a call from her son, Kuno, who wants her to come visit him in person. She initially refuses, telling him that it would be a waste of time. She would rather stay in her room and focus on producing ideas.

Besides, why speak in person when they could communicate perfectly well through the Machine? But her son is persistent, and even Vashti observes that "the Machine did not transmit nuances of expression [...] it only gave a general idea of people - an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes." When giving a lecture, her audience "heard her, fairly well, and saw her, fairly well." Eventually she agrees to visit him.

**He predicts the end of travel.**

She leaves her room and begins her journey across through the Machine. People aren't forbidden from travelling, but few bother to do it: "thanks to the advance of science, the earth was exactly alike all over. [...] What was the good of going to Peking when it was just like Shrewsbury? Why return to Shrewsbury when it would all be like Peking? Men seldom moved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul."

**He predicts enduring norms of social distancing.**

Most of Vashti's journey takes place in an airship. At one point she is disturbed by a ray of sunlight that shines through the broken windowblinds in her cabin. She nearly faints from the horror of it, and an attendant reaches out to catch her as she falls—which Vashti finds even more horrifying:

> “How dare you!” exclaimed [Vashti]. “You forget yourself!” [The attendant] was confused, and apologized for not having let her fall. People never touched one another. The custom had become obsolete, owing to the Machine.

**He predicts the plight of the homeless.**

Eventually she reaches her son, who tells her in person what he wouldn't say through the Machine: he had gone to the surface of the Earth without a permit. He had found a crack in the Machine and had escaped to wander the hills above, until he was mysteriously pulled back down and struck unconscious, only to reawaken in his room. Vashti is certain that her son's behavior will result in "Homelessness": permanent banishment to the surface, and death from the toxic air. She dismisses him as insane and departs, never to see him again.

**He predicts the preponderance of remakes and remixes in the media we create and consume.**

Vashti returns to her previous life, and throws herself with renewed energy into the production of ideas. We learn from one of her lecturers that not all ideas are equally valued:

> “Beware of first-hand ideas!” exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. “First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by love and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing element—direct observation."

(This lecturer would agree that [covers shouldn't just be for musicians](https://davidklaing.com/essays/covers-shouldnt-just-be-for-musicians)...)

**He predicts the importance of respirators. (!)**

As if to underscore this rejection of direct observation, new laws are passed to abolish respirators, thereby forbidding people from ever visiting the surface without risking death.

**He predicts the Complacent Class.**

Soon, Vashti and her many friends begin to notice defects in the Machine. At first, the music doesn't sound as good—there is a "jarring noise" that occasionally interrupts it. Then the artificial fruit that they eat starts be served mouldy. Then the bath water begins to stink, and the "poetry machine" emits "defective rhymes". Vashti receives another call from her son, whom she now hasn't spoken to in years. He tells her "The Machine stops." Vashti discusses his message with her friend, still thinking her son is crazy. They agree that "the phrase means nothing to me."

But the Machine continues to deteriorate, and the worse it gets, the more complacent the people become. All the problems are "bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse to unchallenged."

**He predicts the end of the world.**

Finally, in what I hope is the least prescient part of the story, the Machine does stop, and the world ends.

> The sin against the body—it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of wrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by which we can alone apprehend—glozing it over with talk of evolution, until the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last sloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars.
