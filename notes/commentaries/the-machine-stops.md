E.M. Forster's short story [The Machine Stops](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4711854-the-machine-stops), published in 1909, gives an eerily prescient account of life in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a short read — about an hour — but it's packed with passages that made my jaw drop for how specifically they describe our technology and culture.

The story takes place in a world where everyone lives in the Machine, a sort of global underground human beehive that protects them from the toxic air on the Earth's surface. Every person lives alone in a hexagonal room through which the Machine provides their every need: food, entertainment, medical care, and the ability to communicate with others via video chats. People spend their days giving and attending virtual lectures; the more upstanding citizens of the world are above all concerned with producing "ideas".

> Advanced thinkers [...] had always held it foolish to visit the surface of the earth. Air-ships might be necessary, but what was the good of going out for mere curiosity and crawling along for a mile or two in a terrestrial motor? The habit was vulgar and perhaps faintly improper: it was unproductive of ideas, and had no connection with the habits that really mattered.

The main character is Vashti, a woman who mostly enjoys her life in the Machine and doesn't question it. Her life is this:

> She made the room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light; she ate and exchanged ideas with her friends, and listened to music and attended lectures; she make the room dark and slept. Above her, beneath her, and around her, the Machine hummed eternally; she did not notice the noise, for she had been born with it in her ears. The earth, carrying her, hummed as it sped through silence, turning her now to the invisible sun, now to the invisible stars. She awoke and made the room light.

One day, Vashti receives a call from her son, Kuno, who wants her to come visit him in person. She initially refuses, telling him that it would be a waste of time. She would rather stay in her room and focus on producing ideas.

Besides, why speak in person when they could communicate perfectly well through the Machine? But even Vashti is aware, though she won't fully admit it to herself, that "the Machine did not transmit nuances of expression [...] it only gave a general idea of people - an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes." When giving a lecture, her audience "heard her, fairly well, and saw her, fairly well."÷

Perhaps her subconscious acknowledgement of the deficiencies of telecommunication, combined with her son's persistence, are what cause her to finally agree to visit him. She leaves her room and begins her journey across through the Machine. People aren't forbidden from travelling, but few do:

> One other passenger was in the lift, the first fellow creature she had seen face to face for months. Few travelled in these days, for, thanks to the advance of science, the earth was exactly alike all over. [...] What was the good of going to Peking when it was just like Shrewsbury? Why return to Shrewsbury when it would all be like Peking? Men seldom moved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul.

Vashti travels in an airship, and at one point is disturbed by a ray of sunlight that shines through the broken windowblinds in her cabin. She nearly faints from the horror of it, and an attendant reaches out to catch her as she falls — which Vashti finds even more horrifying:

> “How dare you!” exclaimed [Vashti]. “You forget yourself!” [The attendant] was confused, and apologized for not having let her fall. People never touched one another. The custom had become obsolete, owing to the Machine.


> “Beware of first-hand ideas!” exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. “First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by live and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing element - direct observation. Do not learn anything about this subject of mine - the French Revolution. Learn instead what I think that Enicharmon thought Urizen thought Gutch thought Ho-Yung thought Chi-Bo-Sing thought LafcadioHearn thought Carlyle thought Mirabeau said about the French Revolution. Through the medium of these ten great minds, the blood that was shed at Paris and the windows that were broken at Versailles will be clarified to an idea which you may employ most profitably in your daily lives.

> And in time” - his voice rose - “there will come a generation that had got beyond facts, beyond impressions, a generation absolutely colourless, a generation seraphically free from taint of personality, which will see the French Revolution not as it happened, nor as they would like it to have happened, but as it would have happened, had it taken place in the days of the Machine.”

On complacency

> Time passed, and they resented the defects no longer. The defects had not been remedied, but the human tissues in that latter day had become so subservient, that they readily adapted themselves to every caprice of the Machine. The sigh at the crises of the Brisbane symphony no longer irritated Vashti; she accepted it as part of the melody. The jarring noise, whether in the head or in the wall, was no longer resented by her friend. And so with the mouldy artificial fruit, so with the bath water that began to stink, so with the defective rhymes that the poetry machine had taken to emit. All were bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse to unchallenged.

The perils of comfort

> Man, the flower of all flesh, the noblest of all creatures visible, man who had once made god in his image, and had mirrored his strength on the constellations, beautiful naked man was dying, strangled in the garments that he had woven.


> The sin against the body - it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of wrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by which we can alone apprehend - glozing it over with talk of evolution, until the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last sloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars.
