#### Bio

I grew up in Ontario. It was a wonderful and fortunate childhood, filled with fantasy novels, James Taylor albums, canoe trips, and chlorine.

I studied everything and nothing in McMaster University's interdisciplinary Arts & Science program, where I found my people.

After graduating I wanted to be employed, and needed some skills, so I moved out West to study in the first cohort of the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

I now teach a course in that program once a year, and otherwise work full-time as a senior data scientist at Imbellus.

I live in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia.
