## Bio

I'm David Laing. I write about data science, books, productivity, and other topics. 

I'm a senior data scientist at Imbellus, a venture-backed startup that is building cognitive assessments. 

Once a year I teach a course on communication and argumentation, in the Master of of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.
