Hi there! I'm a data scientist and teacher. I live in Vancouver, BC.

My full-time job is on the data science team at [Imbellus](https://www.imbellus.com/), a venture-backed startup that is building simulation-based cognitive assessments. At Imbellus I write scoring software, develop predictive models of hiring outcomes, and analyse telemetry data to inform assessment designs.

Once a year I also teach a course on communication and argumentation, in the [Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. The course is about how to design clear explanations, and how to be persuasive and accurate when reasoning about data.
