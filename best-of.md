<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Right! The supposed sacredness of books explains so much that would otherwise seem strange, like the fact that it feels so wrong to read only 50% of a book, or that novice writers never write "covers" of their fav books (the way novice musicians learn covers of their fav songs).”</p>&mdash; David Laing (@davidklaing) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1180586417941929985">October 5, 2019</a></blockquote>
