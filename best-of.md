- no side projects
- no diligent note-taking
- stop tracking your habits
- stop trying to produce content
- spend more time with loved ones
- throw away your list of Great Books that you think will make you an Educated Person, and just read for fun”</p>&mdash; David Laing (@davidklaing) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1234746395610898432">March 3, 2029</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“All of those are great, and I'd add one more: for every tweet you send, reply to someone else.

Finding conversational accounts is great, but you have to also *be* a conversational account. Even with few followers, it's easy to slip into broadcasting mode if you're not careful.”</p>&mdash; David Laing (@davidklaing) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1200467236101578752">November 29, 2019</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Confirmation bias makes a lot more sense under the lens, "people don't have ideas, ideas have people."

When someone's views are challenged and they start digging in their heels, what you're really seeing is the thrashing of a parasite that has a death grip on its host.”</p>&mdash; David Laing (@davidklaing) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1163841215017750529">August 20, 2019</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Responsiveness is such an underrated ingredient for friendship.

It almost doesn't matter how you respond if you can consistently do it immediately.

Responsive friendships self-sustain via positive feedback loops; laggy ones suffocate via negative feedback loops.”</p>&mdash; David Laing (@davidklaing) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1225685248786059266">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>

✅ Keep track of everything in my head
✅ Procrastinate a single task for 6 months (e.g. "Reply to Doug")
✅ Download a new productivity app
✅ Spend 3 hours charting out my entire life in the app
✅ Reply to Doug
✅ Immediately forget about the app
✅ Repeat”</p>&mdash; David Laing (@davidklaing) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1180586417941929985">October 5, 2019</a></blockquote>
