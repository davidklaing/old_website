## What am I working on?

I'm a senior data scientist at [Imbellus](https://imbellus.com/), an LA-based startup that makes simulation-based cognitive assessments, for use by employers and educators.

I write scoring logic, develop predictive models of hiring outcomes, and conduct analyses to inform assessment designs. I also present to clients, interview candidates for our growing team, and collaborate with psychometricians, learning scientists, game designers, AI researchers, and engineers.

The data science team that I work on has a small office in Vancouver, Canada, where I live. See this [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-19/a-harvard-dropout-s-plan-to-fix-college-admissions-with-video-games) to learn more about the company, or watch our CEO Rebecca Kantar's talk at [Google](youtube.com/watch?v=JoTlMNamSAg).
