> She made the room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light; she ate and exchanged ideas with her friends, and listened to music and attended lectures; she made the room dark and slept. Above her, beneath her, and around her, the Machine hummed eternally; she did not notice the noise, for she had been born with it in her ears. The earth, carrying her, hummed as it sped through silence, turning her now to the invisible sun, now to the invisible stars. She awoke and made the room light.

The above passage was written in 1909. It is from E.M. Forster's short story *[The Machine Stops](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4711854-the-machine-stops)*, which gives an eerily prescient account of life in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. It takes only an hour to read, but it's packed with passages that made my jaw drop for how specifically they describe our situation. Much like a Black Mirror episode, it imagines taking aspects of modern life to the extreme. But unlike a Black Mirror episode, it was written over a hundred years ago.

The story takes place in a world where everyone lives in the Machine, a massive underground human beehive that offers protection from the toxic air on the Earth's surface. Every person lives alone in a hexagonal room through which the Machine provides their every need: food, entertainment, medical care, and the ability to communicate with others via video chats. People spend their days giving and attending virtual lectures; the more upstanding citizens of the world are above all concerned with producing "ideas".

It's hard not to wonder whether *The Machine Stops* will become more and more prophetic in years to come. What, exactly, does Forster predict? And how have those predictions turned out so far?

## Self-isolation.

Forster foresaw a world where everyone lives alone, and few venture outside their rooms to interact in person.

> Beneath those corridors of shining tiles were rooms, tier below tier, reaching far into the earth, and in each room there sat a human being, eating, or sleeping, or producing ideas.

Forster's dark premonition is thankfully more extreme than the world we live in. But even before the pandemic, we were trending more toward isolation than away from it. Since the publication of _The Machine Stops_, the prevalence of one-person households has risen exponentially.

## The end of originality.

In what felt like a direct reference to Twitter and the blogosphere, Forster described a world where people spend almost all their energy on producing ideas. But not all ideas are equally valued:

> “Beware of first-hand ideas!” exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. “First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by love and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing element—direct observation."

I probably don't need to point out the irony of the context in which you're reading *these* ideas. If you're familiar with my writing, you know that I'm not merely a participant in the culture of [everything being a remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc); I'm a [perpetuator](https://davidklaing.com/essays/covers-shouldnt-just-be-for-musicians) of it.

## The ubiquity, and the inadequacy, of video conferencing.

People in the Machine almost never see each other in person. Instead, they communicate through tablet-like devices that transmit video and audio. These devices are good, but not perfect. When speaking with her son, Vashti notes that "the Machine did not transmit nuances of expression [...] it only gave a general idea of people—an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes." When giving a lecture, her audience "heard her, fairly well, and saw her, fairly well."

This paints an accurate picture of modern video conferencing software. While it's getting better every year, and while VR/AR may smooth out some of the kinks, video conferencing remains frustratingly low-bandwidth, relative to in-person communication. It doesn't allow eye contact; it cuts out if the internet connection is weak; it doesn't facilitate the use of 3-dimensional space. Yes, it's perfectly serviceable "for all practical purposes". But at its best, it simply allows us to see each other, _fairly_ well, and hear each other, _fairly_ well.

## The end of geographic mobility.

In the Machine, people aren't forbidden from travelling, but few bother to do it:

> Thanks to the advance of science, the earth was exactly alike all over. [...] What was the good of going to Peking when it was just like Shrewsbury? Why return to Shrewsbury when it would all be like Peking? Men seldom moved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul.

Tyler Cowen worries in his book [The Complacent Class](https://www.amazon.com/Complacent-Class-Self-Defeating-Quest-American/dp/1250108691) about how Americans are less and less likely to move away from their hometowns. He [writes in Time](https://time.com/4677919/tyler-cowen-book/) that "the interstate migration rate has fallen 51 percent below its 1948–1971 average, and that number has been falling steadily since the mid-1980s."

The travel restrictions caused by the pandemic won't last forever, but it's hard to imagine that the new normal would involve an *increase* in travel and mobility, especially as remote communication tools make it increasingly easy for people to stay put.

## Social distancing norms.

One scene reads like it could have happened last week at my local supermarket. A passenger in an airship nearly faints, and an attendent reaches out to catch her as she falls.

> “How dare you!” exclaimed the passenger. “You forget yourself!” The woman was confused, and apologized for not having let her fall. People never touched one another. The custom had become obsolete, owing to the Machine.

Who knows how extreme this episode might appear, ten or twenty years from now? I'm not so pessimistic to think we'll never touch each other again, but it seems likely that e.g. handshakes and cheek kissing are now relics of history.

## Complacency.

Near the end of the story, people start to notice defects in the Machine. At first, the music doesn't sound as good—there is a "jarring noise" that occasionally interrupts it. Then the artificial fruit that they eat starts be served mouldy. Then the bath water begins to stink, and the "poetry machine" emits "defective rhymes". The worse things get, the more complacent the people become. All the problems are "bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse to unchallenged."

The level of complacency Forster predicts is more extreme than what I perceive in our society, but it's hard to say—most of us live pretty comfortable lives, and don't have much to protest. When we do protest, we do it awfully gently compared to previous generations. I don't think Forster would not be surprised to learn about [slacktivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism).

## The end of the world.

In what I hope is the least prescient part of the story, the Machine does stop, and the world ends. All of Forster's descriptions of this event are vivid and haunting, but one in particular stood out:

> The sin against the body—it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of wrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by which we can alone apprehend—glozing it over with talk of evolution, until the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last sloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars.

There is no denying that compared to the lives of our ancestors, ours are far less gritty, less embodied. Am I still part of that spirit that grasped the stars? Or am I white pap? Well, today I spent ten hours sitting indoors, listening to music, messaging with friends, producing second-hand ideas. Soon, I'll make the room dark.
