> She made the room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light; she ate and exchanged ideas with her friends, and listened to music and attended lectures; she made the room dark and slept. Above her, beneath her, and around her, the Machine hummed eternally; she did not notice the noise, for she had been born with it in her ears. The earth, carrying her, hummed as it sped through silence, turning her now to the invisible sun, now to the invisible stars. She awoke and made the room light.

The passage above was written in 1909. It is from E.M. Forster's short story *[The Machine Stops](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4711854-the-machine-stops)*, which gives an eerily prescient account of life in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I haven't read much of Forster's other writings, so for all I know he made hundreds of other fictional 'predictions' that didn't pan out at all. But when a work of speculative fiction turns out to describe the distant future as comprehensively as does *The Machine Stops*, it deserves a close reading. Not because it gives further clues to the future, although it may. More because it offers something rare: a chronological outsider's perspective on the present. A hundred years from now, our descendants might watch Black Mirror looking for *our* perspective on *their* world.

## Isolation

Even before the pandemic, we were trending more toward isolation than away from it. Since the publication of _The Machine Stops_, the prevalence of one-person households has risen logarithmically.

Forster's world lies at the end of that sigmoid, and it's dark. The Machine is a massive underground human beehive that offers protection from the toxic air on the Earth's surface. Every person lives alone in a hexagonal room through which the Machine provides their every need: food, entertainment, medical care, and the ability to communicate with others via video chats.

> Beneath those corridors of shining tiles were rooms, tier below tier, reaching far into the earth, and in each room there sat a human being, eating, or sleeping, or producing ideas.

In Forster's world, humans are devoid of family and community, more like resources than people.

## Telecommunication

Video conferencing software is more present than ever. While it gets better every year, it remains frustratingly low-bandwidth, relative to in-person communication. It doesn't allow eye contact; it cuts out if the internet connection is weak; it doesn't facilitate the use of 3-dimensional space.

Forster forsaw both the ubiquity and the shortcomings of this technology. People in the Machine communicate through tablet-like devices that transmit video and audio. These devices are good, but not perfect. In one scene, the main character is speaking with her son, who lives on the opposite side of the world: 

> He broke off, and she fancied that he looked sad. She could not be sure, for the Machine did not transmit nuances of expression. It only gave a general idea of people - an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes.

Decades before the rise of personal computing, Forster was aware that advanced telecommunication tools would fail to convey the nuances of in-person communication. When giving a lecture, the main character's audience "heard her, fairly well, and saw her, fairly well." 

## Immobility

One of the effects of better telecommunication tools is that physical transportation is often unnecessary. Tyler Cowen worries in his book [The Complacent Class](https://www.amazon.com/Complacent-Class-Self-Defeating-Quest-American/dp/1250108691) about how Americans are less and less likely to move away from their hometowns. He [writes in Time](https://time.com/4677919/tyler-cowen-book/) that "the interstate migration rate has fallen 51 percent below its 1948–1971 average, and that number has been falling steadily since the mid-1980s."

In the Machine, people aren't forbidden from relocating, but few bother to do it.

> Thanks to the advance of science, the earth was exactly alike all over. [...] What was the good of going to Peking when it was just like Shrewsbury? Why return to Shrewsbury when it would all be like Peking? Men seldom moved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul.

In Forster's imagination, the end of geographic mobility implies stagnation and malaise.

## Second-hand ideas

Social media has turned us all into remixers, arbitragers, and stewards of ideas. Nobody really says anything original anymore, and maybe that's fine. [Everything is a remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc). [Covers shouldn't just be for musicians](https://davidklaing.com/essays/covers-shouldnt-just-be-for-musicians).

Forster saw this coming:

> “Beware of first-hand ideas!” exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. “First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by love and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing element—direct observation. Do not learn anything about this subject of mine—the French Revolution. Learn instead what I think that Enicharmon thought Urizen thought Gutch thought Ho-Yung thought Chi-Bo-Sing thought LafcadioHearn thought Carlyle thought Mirabeau said about the French Revolution. Through the medium of these ten great minds, the blood that was shed at Paris and the windows that were broken at Versailles will be clarified to an idea which you may employ most profitably in your daily lives."

By the way, I encourage you to share this. Tell people what you think David Laing thought E.M. Forster thought about originality.

## Disembodiment

Compared to the lives of our ancestors, ours are far less gritty. First we moved from the country to the city; now we are moving from the physical to the virtual. What will happen to our bodies in the next century? What will they be _for_, if anything?

In what I hope is the least prescient part of Forster's story, the Machine does stop, and the world ends. All of his descriptions of this event are haunting, but one in particular stood out:

> The sin against the body—it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of wrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by which we can alone apprehend—glozing it over with talk of evolution, until the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last sloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars.

I wonder: am I still part of that spirit that grasped the stars? Or am I "white pap"? I know which answer I want to give. But today I spent ten hours sitting indoors, listening to music, messaging with friends, producing second-hand ideas. Soon, I'll make the room dark.
