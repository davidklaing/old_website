## What's my story?

I grew up in Peterborough, Ontario. It was a wonderful and fortunate childhood, filled with fantasy novels, James Taylor albums, canoe trips, and swim meets.

I studied everything and nothing in McMaster University's interdisciplinary <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_Arts_and_Science">Arts & Science program</a>, where I found my people.

After a year of teaching writing at a Niagara College in Welland, Ontario, I decided to train as a data scientist. I moved to the west coast to study in the first cohort of the <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/">Master of Data Science program</a> at the University of British Columbia.

I now live in Vancouver with my partner. I love listening to music, playing chess, bouldering with friends, and biking everywhere no matter how hard it's raining.

## What do I do for work?

I'm a senior data scientist at <a class="external-link" target="_self" href="https://imbellus.com/">Imbellus</a>, an LA-based startup that makes simulation-based cognitive assessments, for use by employers and educators.

I write scoring logic, develop predictive models of hiring outcomes, and do analyses to inform assessment designs. I also present to clients, interview candidates for our growing team, and collaborate with psychometricians, learning scientists, game designers, AI researchers, and engineers.
