I grew up in Peterborough, Ontario. It was a wonderful and fortunate childhood, filled with fantasy novels, James Taylor albums, canoe trips, and chlorine.

I studied everything and nothing in McMaster University's interdisciplinary Arts & Science program, where I found my people.

Later I moved to Vancouver, British Columbia to study in the first cohort of the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia. After graduating, I taught a course on communication and argumentation in the program for three years.

I am now a senior data scientist at Imbellus. I live in Vancouver, British Columbia.
