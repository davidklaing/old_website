Don’t try to psych your opponent out by playing really fast. It might work, but only on weak players, and either way you’ll lose an opportunity to learn.</p><p>3. Don’t get too hung up on your Elo rating. Play chess (the game), not Elo (the meta-game).</p><p>4. If you’re on a losing streak, take a break. Don’t play rage-chess. I don’t always follow this advice myself…</p><p>5. If someone tries to taunt you or insult you in the chat, do your best to ignore it and just play your game. Should go without saying, but don’t taunt others.</p><p>6. Unless you’re Magnus Carlsen, don’t take any of this too seriously. (Easier said than done! My favourite chess quote: “Every chess player should have a hobby.”)</p><p>7. Don’t copy your opponent’s moves. If someone does this to you, don’t get psyched out; after all, it means your opponent is letting you do their thinking for them. Just look for your opportunity.</p></div>'
