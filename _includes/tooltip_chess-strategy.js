You can go to more places from the center than you can from the edges.</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/control_the_center.png" width="100%"/></p><p>2. In your first 10 moves or so, try not to move the same piece twice.</p><p>3. Start by developing your minor pieces (your knights and bishops), but don’t send them too far afield. A good position to aim for might look like this:</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/develop_minor_pieces.png" width="70%"/></p><p>4. Castle early. Ideally before your tenth move, but in general the sooner the better. This has two advantages: it stows your king away safely in the corner, and it connects your rooks.</p><p>5. Connect your rooks: create a straight open line between them. This allows them to protect each other; if one gets captured, the other can recapture to make up the loss.</p><p>6. Don’t double up your pawns. This prevents them from protecting each other, and means that the one behind can’t advance until the one ahead does.</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/doubled_pawns.png" width="70%"/></p><p>7. Don’t leave your pieces undefended. Let’s look back at the position from tip #3. White has two pieces that are undefended, i.e. if black were to capture them, white couldn’t recapture on those square. Can you spot them?</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/undefended_pieces.png" width="70%"/></p><p>8. Always look for check. If it’s available, it is almost always your best move, for the simple reason that it drastically limits your opponent’s options.</p><p>9. Bishops are worth slightly more than knights. So try to avoid trading your bishops for your opponent’s knights, and look for opportunities to trade your knights for your opponent’s bishops.</p><p>10. When you’re winning, initiate trades. A small advantage in the mid-game will become a large advantage on the endgame. When you’re losing, avoid trades. You want to keep the board as complex as possible for your opponent to avoid letting their advantage compound.</p><p>11. If you can plant a minor piece in your opponent’s territory such that it’s defended by one of your pawns and can’t be threatened by any of their pawns, it can be a tremendous thorn in their side.</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/thorn_in_their_side.png" width="70%"/></p><p>12. When the two players have castled on opposite sides, the game becomes a race to get as many pieces as possible close to the other player’s king. I don’t know why it works like this, but it does. Don’t lose the race!</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/race_to_the_king.png" width="70%"/></p><p>13. In general, try to advance your C pawn before advancing your queenside knight. In the position below, black is going to have a hard time advancing their C pawn, which will block in their queen and generally stifle their development.</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/c_pawn_before_queenside_knight.png" width="70%"/></p><p>14. It often seems to work well to push your H pawn so as to disrupt your opponent’s king’s pawn fortress.</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/push_your_h_pawn.png" width="70%"/></p><p>15. Coordinate your knights so that they can protect each other. (This is similar to tip #5, i.e. connect your rooks.)</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/knight_coordination.png" width="70%"/></p><p>16. The more pawns are on light squares, the more valuable the dark-square bishops. (Because they can still move around the board.) Conversely, the more pawns are on dark squares, the more valuable the light-square bishops. The dark-square bishops are much more valuable here:</p><p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/chess/weak_in_dark.png" width="70%"/></p></div>'
