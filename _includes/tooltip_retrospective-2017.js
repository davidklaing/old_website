I would say that there were only two books I really loved, which I would confidently recommend to any curious friend:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365"><em>Algorithms to Live By</em></a>, by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths    <ul><li>It’s rare that I read a book that touches on so many foundational concepts in an academic discipline (in this case, computer science) and also relates to so much of daily life. I finished this book in early October, and I’ve thought about it almost every week since.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Happiness-Hypothesis-Finding-Modern-Ancient/dp/0465028020/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514328713&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+happiness+hypothesis"><em>The Happiness Hypothesis</em></a>, by Jonathan Haidt    <ul><li><em>The Happiness Hypothesis</em> is to psychology as <em>Algorithms to Live By</em> is to computer science. Haidt is an incredible writer, and I’ve thought about ideas in this book many times since I finished it.</li></ul></li></ul><p>There were several others that I liked quite a bit, but which I would recommend more tentatively. Alphabetically by author’s last name:</p><ul><li><em>How to Fail at Everything and Still Win Big</em>, by Scott Adams</li><li><em>Superintelligence</em>, by Nick Bostrom</li><li><em>Sapiens</em>, by Yuval Noah Harrari</li><li><em>Homo Deus</em>, by Yuval Noah Harrari</li><li><em>The Nurture Assumption</em>, by Judith Rich Harris</li><li><em>Chaos</em>, by James Gleick</li><li><em>Never Let Me Go</em>, by Kazuo Ishiguro</li><li><em>Houston, We Have a Narrative</em>, by Randy Olson</li><li><em>Everybody Lies</em>, by Seth Stevens-Davidowitz</li><li><em>Inadequate Equilibria</em>, by Eliezer Yudkowsky</li></ul><p>I don’t often reread books, but this year I reread two. That fact alone should recommend them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0670025852/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1514328774&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+sense+of+style"><em>The Sense of Style</em></a>, by Steven Pinker</li><li><a href="http://www.hpmor.com/"><em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em></a>, by Eliezer Yudkowsky</li></ul><p>I also read <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"><em>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</em></a> from start to finish, which felt like quite an accomplishment. I think this was the first time I’ve ever read an entire textbook. For anyone who aspires to do this sort of thing, I highly recommend forming a reading group with two to three others. Two of my friends and I read a chapter or two each week, and met for a few hours to talk through the practice problems.</p><h2 id="articles">Articles</h2><p>Alphabetical by author’s last name.</p><ul><li><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/">A Modern Myth</a>, by Scott Alexander</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@rchang/advice-for-new-and-junior-data-scientists-2ab02396cf5b?source=user_profile---------1----------------">Advice for New and Junior Data Scientists</a>, by Robert Chang</li><li><a href="https://juliagalef.com/2017/01/06/a-taxonomy-of-books-that-change-your-worldview/">A taxonomy of ways books change your worldview</a>, by Julia Galef</li><li><a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/">Are pop lyrics getting more repetitive?</a>, by Colin Morris</li><li><a href="http://lukemuehlhauser.com/three-wild-speculations-from-amateur-quantitative-macrohistory/">Three wild speculations from amateur quantitative macrohistory</a>, by Luke Muelhauser</li><li><a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/">Research Debt</a>, by Chris Olah and Shan Carter</li><li><a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-hard-way/">Don’t teach students the hard way first</a>, by David Robinson</li></ul><h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2><p>Alphabetical by title.</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/ben-sasse-tyler-cowen-book-twitter-trump-cb5b4a435323">Ben Sasse on the Space between Nebraska and Neverland</a> – Conversations with Tyler</li><li><a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/biology-and-culture">Biology and Culture – A Conversation with Bret Weinstein</a> – Waking Up with Sam Harris</li><li><a href="http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-177-dylan-matthews-on-the-science-and-ethics-of-kidney-do.html">Dylan Matthews on “The science and ethics of kidney donation”</a> – Rationally Speaking</li><li><a href="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/112">Gettier Goggles</a> – Very Bad Wizards</li><li><a href="https://www.benbenandblue.com/episodes/2017/9/4/bbb-2-lecturingbloodletting-so-why-are-we-still-doing-it">Lecturing=Bloodletting, so why are we still doing it?</a> – Ben, Ben and Blue</li></ul><h2 id="videos">Videos</h2><p>Alphabetical by creator’s last name.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gksxu-yeWcU&amp;t">Passengers, Rearranged</a>, by Evan Puschak</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">Neural networks (playlist)</a>, by Grant Sanderson</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCytJvd4H0">Science Youtubers attempting a graph theory puzzle</a>, by Grant Sanderson</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DGdDQrXv5U">Mr. Rogers and the Power of Persuasion</a>, by Will Schoder</li></ul><h2 id="music">Music</h2><p>Where to begin!
