A few examples:</p><ul><li>Knowing I’ll clear my email inbox every week makes me feel completely fine about signing up for new mailing lists. If I find I don’t enjoy the first few issues, I just unsubscribe.</li><li>Knowing I’ll clear out my Desktop folder every week gives me the confidence to use it as a convenient extension of my working memory when working through a problem.</li><li>Knowing I’ll clean the kitchen every evening allows me to spread ingredients and tools all over the place when cooking a meal.</li><li>Knowing I’ll only submit modular, well-tested code for pull requests gives me the freedom to muck around in a notebook and add tons of print statements when programming.</li></ul><p>Many of these freedoms would feel gratuitous if I didn’t trust my future self to keep entropy in check. Counterintuitively, the better you are at tidying up, the more you can delight in chaos.</p></div>'
