Some products I really like:

- [Fitbit Charge 3](https://www.fitbit.com/en-ca/charge3)
  - I got my Fitbit in December 2018, and while the heart rate and step counting is useful, its main benefit is that it has significantly increased the amount of sleep I get. What I didn't appreciate before was how much of my time in bed is spent awake. I used to think that if my alarm went off eight hours after I turned out my light and closed my eyes, then I got eight hours of sleep. Now I know better: to actually get eight hours of sleep, I need to spend at least nine and a half hours in bed. I don't often hit that bar, but I would guess that the introduction of this extra feedback loop has caused me to get on average 45 minutes more sleep per night than I did before. I would pay *way* more than $160 for that. But the Fitbit is great: no distracting smartwatch features, super long battery life, and very comfortable.
