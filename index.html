    Welcome! I'm David Laing. I'm a senior data scientist at <a href="https://www.imbellus.com/">Imbellus</a>, a startup that builds simulation-based cognitive assessments.
    <br><br>
    I write to share my learning, to give more life to ideas that I think are underappreciated, and to make it easier for my future friends to find me. Perhaps you are one of them? Say hello on <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing">Twitter</a>, or let me send you a monthly note with links to what I'm reading and writing:
