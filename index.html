    I write to share my learning, to give more life to ideas that I think are underappreciated, and to make it easier for my future friends to find me. Perhaps you are one of them? Say hello on <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing">Twitter</a>, or let me send you a monthly note with links to what I'm reading and writing:
